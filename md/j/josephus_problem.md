The following problem is called the Josephus problem:

m people stand in a circle, and an extra person goes round the circle
eliminating every $n^{th}$ person. When the end of the circle is
reached, we go round again, ignoring people who have already been
eliminated, and still eliminating every $n^{th}$ person. The problem:
given m and n, where should I stand in the circle so that I will be the
last to be eliminated?
