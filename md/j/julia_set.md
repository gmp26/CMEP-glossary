The iterated mapping $ z \mapsto z^2 + k $ has a strange attractor for
certain values of k. This attractor is called a Julia set.

For other values of k the mapping goes to infinity or to a fixed point.
Values of k for which the mapping does not go to infinity are said to
lie in the Mandelbrot set.

If the starting point of the mapping lies in this Mandelbrot set, then
the Julia set will be a connected set. Otherwise it will be disconnected
dust, called Fatou dust.

Other mappings may be used, for instance $ z \mapsto a \cos z + k ; $
the strange attractors of these mappings are also called Julia sets,
though they do not have the same connection with the Mandelbrot set.
