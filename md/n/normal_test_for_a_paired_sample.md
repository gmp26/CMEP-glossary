This is a test of the null hypothesis that the difference in two
population means is $ \mu , $ given a paired sample $(x_{i},$ $y_{i})$
of size n. The distribution used is N(0,1), and the test statistic is
$ \frac{ ( \bar{x} - \bar{y} ) - \mu }
{\sigma / \sqrt{n} } . $ This test is identical to the normal test for a
mean, treating the differences $x_{i}-y_{i}$ as a single sample.
