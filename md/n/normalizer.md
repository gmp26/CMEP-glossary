Of a subgroup $ H $ of a group $ G $ : the set
$$N_G(H)= \\{g \in G \mid gHg ^{-1}=H \\}.$$ This is the stabilizer of
the conjugacy action of $ G $ on its subgroups. Note that
$ H \triangleleft N_G(H) $ , and that $ N_G(H) $ is the largest subgroup
of $ G $ in which $ H $ is normal. Compare centralizer.
