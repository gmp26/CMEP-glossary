When we talk about a number system we are usually talking about the way
of counting using a particular base. The usual number system is called
base 10, because it uses ten different digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9 - when we get to the next number after this we have to use two
symbols together: 10.

Other number systems which have sometimes been used have base 2, 3, 16
or 60.
