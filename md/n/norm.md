A norm on a vector space is:

A mapping from elements of the vector space to the real numbers; it is
positive for every element of the space, and zero only for the zero
element. The norm of element v is denoted ||v||

If n is a real number, then ||nv||=|n|.||v||

$ \\| u+v \\| \leq \\| u \\| + \\| v \\| , $ for all u and v in the
space.

A norm may be used to define a metric: d(x,y)=||x-y||.

A norm on a matrix is a norm on the vector space of matrices.
