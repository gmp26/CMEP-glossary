A certain set of those NP problems for which no general deterministic
polynomial-time algorithm is known, is called the set of NP-complete (or
NP-hard) problems. The problems in this set are ’equally hard’ in the
sense that if any one of them could be solved by a polynomial-time
algorithm, so in principle could all the others. It is not known whether
this is the case, though it is widely believed that it is not.
