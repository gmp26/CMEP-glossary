The number of permutations of $n$ objects (the number of ways of
arranging them) is $n!$ or $n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times \dots
  \times 2 \times 1$. This is because the number of ways of choosing the
first object is $n$; the number of ways of choosing the second object is
$n-1$ (since one object has already gone); the number of ways of
choosing the third object is n-2, etc.
