This is a test of the null hypothesis that the proportion of population
members having a given property is $ \theta . $ We have a sample of size
n in which p of the members have the property. The distribution used is
normal, and the test statistic is
$$\frac{p - \theta }{\sqrt{ \frac{\theta ( 1 - \theta ) }{n} } } .$$

This is an approximate test, and the sample size should be large.
$ \theta $ should not be too close to 0 or 1.
