​1) A particle continues in a state of rest of uniform motion in a
straight line unless a force acts on it.

2)If a resultant force acts on a particle, the particle’s linear
momentum changes at a rate proportional to the size of the force and in
the same direction as the force: $ F = \frac{d}{dt}(mv) . $ (In the
special case where the mass is constant, this becomes F=ma.

3)When one object exerts a force upon another by contact, there is
always a force of reaction equal in size and opposite in direction to
the acting force.
