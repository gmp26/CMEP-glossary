A test of the null hypothesis that the population mean has value
$ \mu . $ The distribution used is N(0,1); the test statistic is
$ \frac{ \bar{x} - \mu }{\sigma / \sqrt{n}} , $ where n is the sample
size; if $ \sigma $ has to be estimated or the population is not
normally distributed, then the test is approximate and a large sample
should be taken.
