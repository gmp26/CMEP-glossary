A net of a cone is a sector of a circle. If the cone has slant height h
and base circumference c then the sector must have radius h and arc
length c. This means that the sector’s central angle is
$ 360 \mathrm{c} / 2 \pi \mathrm{h} $ degrees.

To make a complete cone we need to attach to the curved edge of the
sector another circle, which will form the cone’s base.
