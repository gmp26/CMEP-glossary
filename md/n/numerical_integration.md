If we were going to integrate numerically to find the area under a
curve, we would divide the area into a lot of thin strips, and then use
the equation of the curve to work out the co-ordinates of the corners of
the strips. From this we can work out the approximate area of each
strip, and then add up all of these areas in order to find the total
area under the curve.

The same kind of process can be used to do other integrations, like
finding the length of a curve or the volume of a solid.

Numerical integration is useful when it is hard or impossible to find,
algebraically, the integral of the relevant function.
