A special case of the test for a given difference in the means: Given
two distributions with the same known variance $ \sigma ^2 , $ this is a
test of the null hypothesis that they have the same mean. We have two
samples $x_{i}$ and $y_{i}$ of sizes m and n. The distribution used is
N(0,1); the test statistic is $$\frac{ \bar{x} - \bar{y} }
{ \sigma \sqrt {\frac{1}{m} + \frac{1}{n} } } .$$ If the two
distributions are not normal, or if the common variance has to be
estimated, the test is approximate and large samples should be used.
