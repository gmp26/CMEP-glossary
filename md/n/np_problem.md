A decision problem is called an NP problem if particular examples of it
can be solved in polynomial time by a nondeterministic process (ie by
generating possible solutions at random, guessing).

There are many problems for which no polynomial-time algorithm is known,
which are NP problems. It is widely believed, but not proven, that there
exist certain problems which can be solved by a non-deterministic but
not by a deterministic process in polynomial time.
