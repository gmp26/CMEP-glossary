If we have $n$ objects and we choose $r$ of them, the number of
permutations of the $r$ objects is $$^{n}P_{r}$$ i.e.
$\frac{n!}{(n-r)!} $ or
$n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times \dots \times (n-r+1)$. This is
because the number of ways of choosing the first object is $n$; the
number of ways of choosing the second object is $n-1$; the number of
ways of choosing the third object is $n-2$; â€¦the number of ways of
choosing the $r^{\mbox{th}}$ object is $n-r+1$. So the number of ways of
making the choice is
$n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times \dots \times (n-r+1)$. For example,
the number of permutations of 3 objects chosen out of five is
$ 5 \times 4 \times 3 = 60 $. Note that $$^{n}P_{n},$$ the number of
permutations of $n$ objects chosen out of $n$, is $n!$.
