If we have $n$ objects, and we choose $r$ of them, but the order in
which we choose them does not matter, the number of ways of doing this
is $^{n}C_{r}$ or $ {n \choose r} = \frac {n!}{(n-r)!r!}. $ This is
because the number of ways of choosing $r$ objects from $n$ is equal to
the number of ways of permuting $r$ objects from $n$, divided by the
number or ways of permuting $r$ objects. This is $$^{n}P_{r}/r!$$
