Numbers that are formed by multiplying ten by itself a particular number
of times. When written in base ten, they end in that number of zeroes.
The first few powers of ten are:

$$\begin{aligned}
  10 = 10^{1} & = & ten \\
  100 =  10^{2} & = & hundred \\
  1000 = 10^{3} & = & thousand \\
  1000000 = 10^{6} & = & million \\
  1000000000 = 10^{9} & = & billion \\
  1000000000000 = 10^{12} & = & trillion \\
  10^{15} & = & quadrillion \\
  10^{18} & = & quintillion \\
  10^{21} & = & sextillion \\
  10^{24} & = & septillion \\
  10^{27} & = & octillion \\
  10^{30} & = & nonillion \\
  10^{33} & = & decillion \end{aligned}$$
