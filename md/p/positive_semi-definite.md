Something (usually a matrix or a polynomial) is called positive
semidefinite if it is always non-negative, or if under some standard
operation it always gives a non-negative value.

For example a symmetric matrix or a quadratic form A is called positive
semidefinite if $x^{T}Ax$ is non-negative for all nonzero vectors x.

Compare positive definite.
