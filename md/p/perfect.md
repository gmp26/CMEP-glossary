A perfect number is equal to the sum of its divisors; eg

6 = 1 + 2 + 3,

28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14

Not many perfect numbers are known, because they become very big very
soon. But there is a formula for generating some of them, known since
Euclidâ€™s time: add together a series of powers of 2 until you get a
prime number, and then multiply by the last power of two you used.

eg, $2^{0}+2^{1}+2^{2}=1+2+4=7,$ which is prime; multiply by 4 to get
28, which is perfect.

All the known perfect number are even.
