If we are given two lines P and Q, meeting at A, and a fixed point X, we
may try to draw a line segment through X which joins P and Q and is as
short as possible. It is in fact not possible to solve this problem
using the rules of traditional geometry (it is equivalent to trying to
double the volume of a give cube).

But we can show that the solution has the following property:

Let the line segment, l, through X meet P and Q at points Y and Z. Draw
a line perpendicular to l, through A, meeting l at F. Then distance
FY=XZ.
