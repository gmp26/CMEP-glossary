Four numbers are said to be in proportion when the ratio of the first
and second numbers is equal to the ratio of the third and fourth
numbers.

e.g.3:4 = 6:8 or 3/4 = 6/8

A good use of proportion are maps which are drawings to scale of things
that actually exist e.g. map measure : real life measure = 1 : 50 000
