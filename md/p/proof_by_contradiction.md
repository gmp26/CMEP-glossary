This is a type of proof where we start off by assuming that what we want
to prove is untrue. Then we work from this assumption, and deduce
whatever things we can. Hopefully, sooner or later we will come to
something that is obviously untrue or contradictory. Then we will know
that our original assumption must have been wrong, because it has led to
a contradiction - so we know that the thing we are trying to prove is
actually true.

For example: to prove that there is no such thing as the highest whole
number.

Assume that there is such a number, and call it N.

Then take N, and add 1; call this M. Then M is a whole number, and M\>N,
which contradicts our assumption that N is the largest whole number. So
we know that it must have been wrong to say that there is a biggest
whole number - which is what we meant to prove.
