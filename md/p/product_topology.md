Let $ (X, \tau ) $ and $ (Y, \sigma ) $ be topological spaces. Then the
product topology on $ X \times Y $ is the collection of all possible
unions of sets of the form $ U \times V $ where $ U \in  \tau  $ and
$ V \in  \sigma  $ . This has the obvious extension to the product
topology on the Cartesian product of $ n $ topological spaces. For
example, the product topology on $ R \times R $ where $ R $ is
$  \mathbb{R} $ with the usual topology, is the same as the usual
topology on $  \mathbb{R}^2 $ .
