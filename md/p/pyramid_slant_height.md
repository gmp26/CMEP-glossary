The slant height of a pyramid is the length of an edge that is not part
of the base.

A pyramid whose base is a regular polygon with n sides of length x has
slant height s. To find s, note that a regular n-gon of side length x
has radius $ R = x / 2 \cos \theta , $ where
$ \theta = ( 90 - \frac{180}{n} ) . $ Then we have $s^{2}=h^{2}+R^{2},$
where h is the height of the pyramid.

So, $ s = \sqrt { h^2 + \frac{x ^2 }{ 4 \cos ^2 \theta } } . $
