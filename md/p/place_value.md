In our number system the position of a digit in a number is important.

For example in the number 45556, the three fives each have a different
value because of where they are placed in the number, in this case, they
are in turn: 5000; 500 and 50.

Our number system is based on groupings of ten and our numbers are
written to show this grouping: In the number 2365 , the 2 represents two
thousands, the 3 represents three hundreds, the 6 represents six tens
and the 5 is five units
