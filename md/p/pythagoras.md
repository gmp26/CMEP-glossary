Pythagoras of Samos (c 569 BC - c 475 BC) - an ancient Greek
mathematician. None of his writings survive, and we know relatively
little about the mathematics which he did. He is said to have been the
leader of a religious/scientific group and to have worked on arithmetic
and geometry. The theorem which we know as Pythagoras’ theorem was known
long before Pythagoras’ time, although Pythagoras himself might have
been the first to prove it. Pythagoras is said to have been one of the
first to believe that the world is fundamentally mathematical, that
phenomena are ruled by mathematical processes. He was interested in the
abstract nature of mathematical concepts such as the natural numbers, or
the idea of a proof. The Pythagoreans are said to have discovered the
irrational numbers, the five regular (Platonic) solids, and to have
shown that the sum of the angles in a triangle is equal to two right
angles.
