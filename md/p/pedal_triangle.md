Given a triangle, if we draw all three of its altitudes and make a new
triangle out of the feet of the three altitudes, then this new triangle
is called the pedal triangle.

Alternatively, if we are given a triangle ABC and a point P, then we can
draw three lines through P perpendicular to the three sides of ABC. We
call the points where these lines meet the sides of ABC X, Y and Z. Then
XYZ is called the pedal triangle of ABC with respect to P.
