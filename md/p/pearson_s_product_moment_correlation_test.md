A test of the null hypothesis that the population value of a correlation
coefficient $ \rho $ is zero. Tables are given for use with this test;
it assumes that the population has a bivariate normal distribution. We
test by finding the probability which corresponds to a tail that just
contains r, where r is Pearsonâ€™s product-moment correlation coefficient.
