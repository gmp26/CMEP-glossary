Probability measures how likely an event or outcome is.

It is usually shown as a success fraction - the number of ways an event
could happen compared to the total number of events that could happen -
and is written: $$\text{probability(of special event)} = 
\frac{\text{(No of times that special event occurs)}}
{\text{(Total number of events occurring)}}$$
