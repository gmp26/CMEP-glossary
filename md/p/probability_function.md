For a discrete random variable X which can take values $x_{i},$ a
probability function is a function $f(x_{i})=p_{i},$ which gives the
probability of X taking each different value.

Note that we must have $ \sum_{\mathrm{i=1}}^{\mathrm{n}}
\mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{i}} = 1 $ if X has n possible values, or
$ \sum_{\mathrm{i=1}}^{\infty}
\mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{i}} = 1 $ if it has infinitely many possible values.
