A projectile is a moving body affected only by gravity.

If a uniform gravitational field a projectile has no horizontal
acceleration, and vertical acceleration equal to -g. It has constant
horizontal speed, and its path is a parabola.

If the initial speed is u, and the projectile leaves the origin
travelling at an angle $ \alpha $ above the horizontal, then at time t
we have:

$ x = ut \cos \alpha , $

$ y = ut \sin \alpha  - \frac{1}{2} g t^2 , $

$ v_x = u \cos \alpha , $

$ v_y = u \sin \alpha - gt . $

It reaches y=0 again at time $ t = \frac{2u \sin \alpha }{g} , $ when
$ x = \frac{u^2}{g} \sin ( 2 \alpha ) . $
