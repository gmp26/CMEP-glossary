If we have a polygon P whose vertices have coordinates which are whole
numbers, then we can find its area as follows:

Consider the lattice of all points whose coordinates are whole numbers.
Let I be the number of these points that lie inside P, and let B be the
number of these points that lie on the boundary of P. The area of P is
I+(B/2)-1.
