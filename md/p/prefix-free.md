A string $ x $ is a prefix in another string $ y $ if $ y=xz $ for some
string $ z $ . A prefix-free code is one in which no codeword is a
prefix in another. Note that every prefix-free code is decipherable, but
the converse is not true. For example, taking the source alphabet to be
$  \\{1,2,3 \\} $ and $ f(1)=1 $ , $ f(2)=01 $ , $ f(3)=001 $ gives a
decipherable code that is not prefix-free. See also Kraft inequality.
