If we have a uniform sample space, then the probability of event E is
$ \mathrm{p(E)} = 
\frac{\text{number of outcomes corresponding to E}}{\text{total number of possible outcomes}}. $
For instance if we are throwing a die, the event E: number\>4
corresponds to 2 out of 6 equally likely outcomes, so p(E)=2/6=1/3.
