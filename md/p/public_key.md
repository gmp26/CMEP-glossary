Some kinds of encryption use two ’keys’; each is a whole number. The
public key is used for encrypting messages to a particular person, and
is made publicly available. It is the product of two very large prime
numbers.

To decode messages, the private key is needed, which can be worked out
by factorising the public key - but this is very hard to do.
