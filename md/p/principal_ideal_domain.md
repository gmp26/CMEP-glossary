The principal ideal generated by $ a \in R $ is defined as
$$(a)= \{ar \mid r \in R \}.$$ A principal ideal domain or PID is a
domain in which every ideal is principal. Such a domain is automatically
a unique factorisation domain and, as such, primes and irreducible
elements are identical in a PID. For example, $ K[X] $ is a PID for any
field $ K $ , but not in general for a ring, e.g. Â  $  \mathbb{Z}[X] $
is not a PID as $  \langle 2,X \rangle $ is not principal.
