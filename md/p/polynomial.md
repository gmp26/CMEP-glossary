A polynomial expression is an expression in which we have whole-numbered
powers of the variable multiplied by numerical coefficients, and added
together. The powers of the variable must be positive integers, or zero.

The general form of a polynomial is:
$$a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + a_3 x^3 + \dots + a_n x^n $$ where the $a_i$ are constants.

e.g. $x^3+7X+22$
