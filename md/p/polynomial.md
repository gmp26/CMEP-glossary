A polynomial expression is an expression in which we have whole-numbered
powers of the variable multiplied by numerical coefficients, and added
together. The powers of the variable must be positive integers, or zero.

eg: $$

<span>l</span> 3x^2^$  + 2x + 1\\
x^{11}$ + 2x\
a~0~ + a~1~x + a~2~x^2^ + a~3~x^3^ + â€¦+ a~n~x^n^

$$
