An inflection point, or point of inflection, is a place on the graph of
a function, where the second derivative of the function is zero. It is a
place where the slope of the graph is not changing, and where the
tangent to the graph intersects the graph at that point. It is where the
graphâ€™s curvature changes from positive to negative.

For instance, y = $x^{3} + x^{2}$ + x + 1 has a point of inflection at
$ \mathrm{x} = - \frac{1}{3}, $

because
$ \frac {\mathrm{d}^2 \mathrm{y}}{\mathrm{dx}^2} = 6 \mathrm{x} + 2, $
which is zero when $ \mathrm{x} = - \frac{1}{3} $
