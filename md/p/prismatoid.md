A polyhedron in which all the vertices lie in one of two parallel
planes. The two faces that lie in these two planes are called the bases
of the prismatoid, but they need not be identical or even similar. The
other faces are called the lateral faces; they will always be triangles,
parallelograms or trapezia.
