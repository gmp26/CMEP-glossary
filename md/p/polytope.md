A polytope is a higher-dimensional analogue of a polyhedron.

In 2 dimensions there are infinitely many possible regular polygons;

In 3 dimensions there are 5 possible regular polyhedra;

In 4 dimensions there are 6 possible regular polytopes;

In each number of dimensions higher than 4, there are 3 possible regular
polytopes, analogous to the three-dimensional tetrahedron, cube and
octahedron.
