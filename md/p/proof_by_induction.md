A type of proof:

We have a hypothesis H, which contains the variable n, which is a whole
number. We want to prove that H is true for every value of n.

​1) So we first prove that H is true for n=1.

​2) Then we prove that H being true for n=k implies that H is true for
n=k+1.

Then we are done, because 1) and 2) together imply that H is true for
n=2; then 2) implies that H is true for n=3; then 2) implies that H is
true for n=4... etc.

H is called the inductive hypothesis.

Some philosophers do not accept this kind of proof, because it takes
infinitely many steps to prove something. But most mathematicians are
happy with it.
