The 5th uniform polyhedron is the Pentagrammic crossed antiprism; it has
Wythoff symbol |2 2 5/3. Its dual is the pentagrammic concave
deltohedron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (3,3,3,5/3);
its symmetry group is the dihedral group D5.

It has:

Euler characteristic: 2

Density: 3

Number of vertices: 10

Number of edges: 20

Number of faces: 12 (=10 triangles and 2<span>5/3</span>).

Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining
every $b^{th}$ of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made
by taking five points and joining every second point.
