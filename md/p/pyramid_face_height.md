The face height of a pyramid is the distance from the apex to the centre
of one of the baseâ€™s edges.

A pyramid whose base is a regular n-gon with side length x and whose
apex is directly above the centre of the base, has face height f.

to find f, note that the short radius of a regular n-gon is
$ r = \frac{x \tan \theta }{2} , $ where
$ \theta = 90 - \frac{180}{n} . $ Then we have $f^{2}=h^{2}+r^{2},$
where h is the height of the pyramid.

So $ f = \sqrt{h^2 + \frac{x^2 \tan ^2 \theta }{4} } . $
