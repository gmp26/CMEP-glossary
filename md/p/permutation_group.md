The set of all permutations of a given set X, together with the
operation of composition of functions. It can be shown that this is
always a group; it is denoted P(X).

The identity operation I(X) is the identity element of P(X); the inverse
operation of a given permutation is that permutationâ€™s inverse in the
group.

The set X may be finite or infinite.
