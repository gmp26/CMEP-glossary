A type of plane geometrical transformation. The perspective affinity
defined by line l, direction d and ratio r operates as follows:

Given a point P, draw a line from P in direction d to meet l at X. Find
P’ such that P’X/PX=r. Then P’ is the image of P under the
transformation.

Isometries, similarities, shears and stretches are all kinds of
perspective affinity.

The composition of one or more perspective affinities is called a
general affinity.
