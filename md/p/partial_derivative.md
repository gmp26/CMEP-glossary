If f(x, y) is a function of both x and y, then the partial derivative of
f with respect to x, written
$ \frac{\partial \mathrm{f}}{\partial \mathrm{x}}, $ is:
$$\frac{\partial \mathrm{f}}{\partial \mathrm{x}}
= \lim_{\mathrm{h} \to 0} \frac {\mathrm{f(x + h, y) - f(x, y)}}{\mathrm{h}}$$

This is equivalent to differentiating with respect to x and treating y
as though it were a constant. It can also be written $f_{x}.$

For example, if
$ \mathrm{f(x, y)} = \mathrm{x}^2 + \mathrm{xy} + 2 \mathrm{y}^2, $

then
$ \frac{\partial \mathrm{f}}{\partial \mathrm{x}} = 2 \mathrm{x + y} $

We can define partial derivatives with respect to z, and of functions of
three or more variables, in the same way.
