Given a conic C and a point P, the polar of P is either

1)the line defined as follows:

Draw a line L through P, which cuts C at A and B. Take the tangents to C
at A and B, and find their intersection X. The locus of X as L varies is
a straight line; this is the polar.

or 2) the line defined as follows:

Find the two tangents T and U of C which pass through P. The points
where these tangents touch C are called D and E. The line M joining D
and E is the polar of P with respect to C. (In this case P is called the
pole of M with respect to C.)

The second of these two is more commonly used - it is also known as the
chord of contact of tangents.
