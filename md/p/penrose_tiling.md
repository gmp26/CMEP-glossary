A nonperiodic (ie it has no translational symmetry) tiling of the plane,
constructed from two different quadrilaterals. The quadrilaterals are a
kite with angles $72^{\circ}$, $72^{\circ}$, $72^{\circ}$ and
$144^{\circ}$, and a ’dart’ or arrowhead with angles $72^{\circ}$,
$36^{\circ}$, $216^{\circ}$ and $36^{\circ}$. The vertices of the tiles
are labelled alternately heads and tails, tails being the re-entrant
angle of the dart and heads being the point and bottom of the kite, and
the tiling is assembled by placing tiles so that only vertices of one
kind, heads or tails, meet at any point.

There are an infinite number of such tilings.
