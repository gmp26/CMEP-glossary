A stochastic process in which distinct events occur in such a way that
the number of events occurring in a given period of time depends only on
the length of the time period. This number of events has a Poisson
distribution with mean $ \lambda \mathrm{t} $ where t is the length of
the time period, and $ \lambda $ is a constant.

The length of time which elapses between two successive events has an
exponential distribution with mean $ 1/ \lambda . $
