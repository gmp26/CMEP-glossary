If we take a fraction A, and write it as the sum of a set of fractions
whose denominators are factors of the denominator of A, then the set of
fractions is called a set of partial fractions.

For example, if we write $ \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{3} $
then $ \frac{1}{2} $ and $ - \frac{1}{3} $ are called partial fractions.
