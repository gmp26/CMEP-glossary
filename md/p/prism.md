A prism is a special kind of polyhedron. It has two ends which are
exactly the same shape and size. These end shapes are parallel to each
other, are separated by rectangles and are often squares.

If a prism is sliced parallel to one of its ends then the new exposed
ends will be exactly the same as the old ones. A prism is the same shape
and size all the way through.
