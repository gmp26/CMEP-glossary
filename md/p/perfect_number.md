A whole number which is equal to the sum of all its factors except
itself. For example, 6 has the factors 1, 2, 3 and 6. Ignoring the six
and adding the rest of the factors, 1 + 2 + 3, gives 6.

Likewise: 28 = 1+2+4+7+14

The next two perfect numbers are 496 and 8128.

There are not many known perfect numbers.

The first five are 6, 28, 496, 8128, 33550336. All perfect numbers end
in 6 or 8 in base 10, but the 6s and 8s do not alternate. All perfect
numbers are of the form $2^{n-1}(2^{n}-1)$ where $2^{n}-1$ is a Mersenne
prime.

It is not known whether there are infinitely many perfect numbers, nor
is it known whether there is an odd perfect number.
