If point X moves along a given path and point Y chases X (ie its
direction of motion is always towards X and its speed is constant) then
Y will describe a curve of pursuit.

Alternatively, we can have three points ABC, with A chasing B, B chasing
C, C chasing A. The result for this and for larger numbers of points is
also called a curve of pursuit.
