The 3rd uniform polyhedron is the Pentagrammic prism; it has Wythoff
symbol 2 5/2|2. Its dual is the pentagrammic dipyramid. The pattern of
polygons round each vertex is (4,4,5/2); its symmetry group is the
dihedral group D5.

It has:

Euler characteristic: 2

Density: 2

Number of vertices: 10

Number of edges: 15

Number of faces: 7 (=5 quadrilaterals and 2<span>5/2</span>).

Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining
every $b^{th}$ of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made
by taking five points and joining every second point.
