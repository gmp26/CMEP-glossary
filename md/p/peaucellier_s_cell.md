A linkage which allows a straight line to be drawn without a ruler.

The linkage consists of a fixed point A and a rhombus of links BCDE; AB
and AD are links also. As point C moves along a curve, E traces out the
inverse of this curve.

By adding a fixed point O and a link OC such that OC=OA, we constrain C
to move on a circle, so E traces out the inverse of a circle; a line.
