A series of standard sizes for untrimmed paper. They are slightly larger
than the corresponding A-series sizes. Printers buy untrimmed paper,
bind it and then trim it down to standard A- sizes.

The ratio of side lengths is the same as for A- series, i.e.
$ 1 : \sqrt{2} , $ and RA0 size has area $1.05m^{2},$ RA1 half this,
etc. So the sizes are:

RA0= 860 $ \times $ 1220 mm;

RA1= 610 $ \times $ 860 mm;

RA2= 430 $ \times $ 610 mm;

RA3= 305 $ \times $ 430 mm;

RA4= 215 $ \times $ 305 mm.
