The 43rd uniform polyhedron is the Rhombidodecadodecahedron; it has
Wythoff symbol 5/2 5|2. Its dual is the medial deltoidal
hexecontahedron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is
(4,5/2,4,5); its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.

It has:

Euler characteristic: -6

Density: 3

Number of vertices: 60

Number of edges: 120

Number of faces: 54 (=12 pentagons and 30 quadrilaterals and
12<span>5/2</span>).

Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining
every $b^{th}$ of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made
by taking five points and joining every second point.
