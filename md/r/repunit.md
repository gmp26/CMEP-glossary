A number whose digits are all units, i.e. 11, 111, etc.

The notation $R_{n}$ is used for the repunit with n digits.

No repunit can be a square, but it is not known if one can be a cube.
Very few of them are prime $(R_{2}, R_{23},$ $R_{19} and R_{317}$ are
the only known prime repunits), but it is not known whether there are
infinitely many prime repunits.
