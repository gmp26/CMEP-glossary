A regular n-gon of side length x has radius R. To find R, consider the
triangle OAX, where O is the centre, A one vertex and X the centre of a
side next to A. We know that the interior angle of a regular n-gon is
$ 180 - \frac{360}{n}, $ so angle OAX= $ \theta = 90 - \frac{180}{n} , $
and we have $ \cos \theta = \frac{x/2}{R} . $

So $ R = \frac{x}{2 \cos \theta } . $
