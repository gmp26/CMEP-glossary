We can find the area under a function f(x) between endpoints x=a and x=b
in the following way:

Divide the interval [a, b] into n parts by points $x_{0}, x_{1},$ ...
$x_{n}, with x_{0}=a and x_{n}=b.$ The subintervals have lengths
$x_{1} - x_{0} ... x_{n} - x_{n-1}.$ Pick a point
$t_{i} in each interval [x_{i}, x_{i+1}].$

Then a Riemann Sum is
$$\mathrm{R} = \sum _{\mathrm{i} =0} ^{\mathrm{n} - 1 } 
( \mathrm{x}_{\mathrm{i} +1} - \mathrm{x} _{\mathrm{i}} ) \mathrm{f(t} _{\mathrm{i}} )$$
Then we can define $ \int _{\mathrm{a}} ^{\mathrm{b}} \mathrm{f(x)dx} $
as the limit of R as the size of the largest subinterval goes to zero.
