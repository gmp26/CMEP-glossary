Regression is a model which describes one random variable as being
dependent of one or more others. Often the relationship between the
variables is a straight-line one, which is called a linear regression.

If we have a random variable X and another variable p, then if we
express the mean of X conditional up on p as a function of p:
$ \mathbb{E} ( X | p ) = f(p) $ then this is called the regression of X
on p.
