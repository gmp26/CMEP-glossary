In a space with n dimensions,
$ \mathrm{x}_1, \mathrm{x}_2, ... \mathrm{x}_{\mathrm{i}} , $ a
Riemannian length function of the form:
$$\sum \mathrm{g}_{\mathrm{ij}} \mathrm{ (x)dx } _{\mathrm{i}} \mathrm{x}_{\mathrm{j}}$$
may be defined and used instead of the normal Pythagorean distance
function. This gives a Riemannian geometry, which has properties like
those of curved space in a gravitational field. Euclidâ€™s fifth axiom
does not hold; nor does the second axiom, which says that a line may be
extended indefinitely in either direction.
