A polygon is said to be regular if all of its sides are equal in length
and all of its angles are equal

A solid is said to be regular if all of its faces are identical and
regular polygons, and all the vertices are the same. The Platonic Solids
are the only regular solids, all the other polyhedra are either
semi-regular or irregular figures.
