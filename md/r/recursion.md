A process that ’bites its own tail’ in some way.

An example is the procedure for finding the factorial of a number; say
we want to find 6!

We know that 6! = 6x5!

And we know that 5! = 5x4!

and 4! = 4x3!

and 3! = 3x2!

and 2! = 2x1!

and 1! = 1x0!

and 0! = 1,

so 1! = 1x1 = 1

so 2! = 2x1 = 2

so 3! = 3x2 = 6

so 4! = 4x6 = 24

so 5! = 5x24 = 120

so 6! = 6x120 = 720.

The process is called recursive because we find one factorial by finding
another; which in turn is found by finding another... until at the
bottom layer there is just one result, 0! = 1, which we already know.
