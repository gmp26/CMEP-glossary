The 28th uniform polyhedron is the Dodecahedron; it has Wythoff symbol
3|2 5. Its dual is the icosahedron. The pattern of polygons round each
vertex is (5,5,5); its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.

It has:

Euler characteristic: 2

Density: 1

Number of vertices: 20

Number of edges: 30

Number of faces: 12 (=12 pentagons).

Its circumradius is $ ( \sqrt{15} + \sqrt{3} ) / 4 $ and its volume is
$ ( 15 + 7 \sqrt{5} ) /4 $ if the edge length is 1.
