If a figure or object looks the same after being reflected in a mirror,
then it has reflectional symmetry. The line where you must put the
mirror for this to work is called the line of symmetry (or in 3D, the
plane of symmetry).

Something may have more than one line of symmetry; in fact a circle has
infinitely many lines of symmetry.
