The 6th uniform polyhedron is the Tetrahedron; it has Wythoff symbol 3|2
3. Its dual is the tetrahedron. The pattern of polygons round each
vertex is (3,3,3); its symmetry group is the tetrahedral group A4.

It has:

Euler characteristic: 2

Density: 1

Number of vertices: 4

Number of edges: 6

Number of faces: 4 (=4 triangles).

Its circumradius is $ \sqrt{6} / 4 $ and its volume is
$ \sqrt {2} / 12   $ if the edge length is 1.
