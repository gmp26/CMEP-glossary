A special strophoid, where the given curve C is a straight line, the
fixed point A lies on this line, and the pole lies on the perpendicular
to C through A.

So, given a line C, a point A on C and a point K on the perpendicular to
C through A, we can construct a right strophoid as follows:

Draw a line l through K which meets C at Q. Find points P and P’ on l so
that QP=QP’=QA. The locus of P and P’ as Q moves on C, is the right
strophoid.

If C is the y-axis, A is the origin and K is at (-a, 0), the curve has
equation: $y^{2}=x^{2}(a+x)/(a-x).$
