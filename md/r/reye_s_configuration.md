Three sets of four concurrent lines, meeting in threes to form a
hexahedron (think of a perspective drawing of a cube, with three
’vanishing points’), together with the four internal diagonals of the
hexahedron and their point of intersection. This configuration of 16
lines and 12 points, with 4 lines through each point and 3 points on
each line, is called Reye’s configuration.

Alternatively, consider the 6 plane faces of this hexahedron, together
with the six diagonal planes passing through pairs of opposite edges.
This configuration of 12 planes and 12 points (6 points on each plane, 6
planes through each point) is called Reye’s configuration.
