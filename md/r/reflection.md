A way of transforming a shape in the same way that a mirror does.

The reflection of a shape in a mirror line is an identical shape which
has been flipped over.

When an object is placed a certain distance in front of a mirror, its
image in the mirror appears the same distance away from edge of the
mirror. Likewise, all the points on a shape and all the points on its
image are same distance away from the ’mirror line’.
