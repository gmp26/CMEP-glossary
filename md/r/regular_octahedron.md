The 10th uniform polyhedron is the Octahedron; it has Wythoff symbol 4|2
3. Its dual is the cube. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is
(3,3,3,3); its symmetry group is the octahedral group S4.

It has:

Euler characteristic: 2

Density: 1

Number of vertices: 6

Number of edges: 12

Number of faces: 8 (=8 triangles).

Its circumradius is $ \sqrt{2} / 2 $ and its volume is $ \sqrt{2} / 3  $
if the edge length is 1.
