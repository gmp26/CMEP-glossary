A variable whose value is determined by a process that we cannot
predict. Random variables are usually denoted by capital letters. Eg if
we roll a die, and let X=the number that comes up on the die, then X is
a random variable.

We can often say that a particular random variable has a particular
distribution, which is some set of information about that probabilities
that the variable will take certain values.

A discrete random variable can only take values from a given discrete
set (often the whole numbers); a continuous random variable can be any
real number in a given range.
