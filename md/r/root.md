The square root of $x$, $ \sqrt{x} $, is what you have to square in
order to get $x$; the cube root of $x$, $ \sqrt[3]{x} $, is what you
have to cube in order to get $x$; etc. We can talk about the nth root of
$x$, $ \sqrt[n]{x} $, which is what you have to raise to the nth power
in order to get $x$. In more advanced mathematics $n$ need not even be a
whole number.
