Let $ D $ be a domain and $ z_0 \in D $ . Then if
$ f:D \setminus  {z_0 } \to \mathbb{C} $ is holomorphic and $ f $ is
bounded near $ z_0 $ then there is a number $ a $ such that
$ f(z) \to a $ as $ z \to z_0 $ . Moreover, if we define
$ g : D \to \mathbb{C} $ by $$g(z)=  \left \{ 
 \begin{array}{cc} 
   f(z) & z \neq z_0 \\ 
   a & z=z_0, 
 \end{array} 
 \right .$$ then $ g $ is holomorphic and we have ‘removed’ the
singularity at $ z_0 $ .
