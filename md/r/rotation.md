Turning; changing of direction. A transformation where a figure turns
through a specific angle about a fixed point, called the centre of
rotation.

The centre of rotation may be inside or outside the figure which is
being transformed. If the figure is turned in an anti-clockwise
direction, the rotation is considered positive, while a negative
rotation turns the figure clockwise.
