If f(x) is continuous in the region
$ \mathrm{a} \leq \mathrm{x} \leq \mathrm{b,} $ differentiable in the
region $ \text{a < x < b,} $ and f(a)=f(b), then there is a point
between a and b at which $ \frac{\mathrm{df}}{\mathrm{dx}} = 0 ,$ i.e.
there is a place where the tangent to the curve is horizontal.
