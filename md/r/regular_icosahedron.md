The 27th uniform polyhedron is the Icosahedron; it has Wythoff symbol
5|2 3. Its dual is the dodecahedron. The pattern of polygons round each
vertex is (3,3,3,3,3); its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.

It has:

Euler characteristic: 2

Density: 1

Number of vertices: 12

Number of edges: 30

Number of faces: 20 (=20 triangles).

Its circumradius is $ \sqrt { 10 + 2 \sqrt {5}} / 4 $ and its volume is
$ 5(3+ \sqrt{5} ) / 12 $ if its edge length is 1.
