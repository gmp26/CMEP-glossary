A polyhedron with twelve plane faces, all of which are identical rhombi.

The particular rhombus which makes this solid has its lengths in ratio
$ \sqrt{2} : 1 , $ and its angles are approximately 70.$5^{\circ}$ and
109.$5^{\circ}$.

The solid can be constructed by taking a cube, placing an identical cube
on each of its faces, and joining the centres of the new cubes to the
vertices of the original.
