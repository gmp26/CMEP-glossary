The 61st uniform polyhedron is the Rhombicosahedron; it has Wythoff
symbol 2 5/2 3|. Its dual is the rhombicosacron. The pattern of polygons
round each vertex is (6,4,6/5,4/3); its symmetry group is the
icosahedral group A5.

It has:

Euler characteristic: -10

It is one-sided; it has

Number of vertices: 60

Number of edges: 120

Number of faces: 50 (=10 hexagons and 15 quadrilaterals and
15<span>4/3</span>and 10<span>6/5</span>).

Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining
every $b^{th}$ of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made
by taking five points and joining every second point.
