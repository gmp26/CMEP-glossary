The paradox which prompted Bertrand Russell and others to re-think the
theory of sets, early in the 20th century:

A set can contain other sets as members. So it is possible for a set to
have a member which is itself. A normal set is a set which does not
contain itself.

Now think of the set of all normal sets. Is it a normal set, or not?
