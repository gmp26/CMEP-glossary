A real number, also called just a real, is a number which can be written
out as a decimal, even though it might take forever to do so.

We use the symbol $ \mathbb{R} $ for the set of all real numbers
$x=k.x_{1}x_{2}x_{3}...$ where k is an integer and each of the $x_{i}$
is one of the digits 0, 1, ...9.

Whole numbers, fractions, irrational and transcendental numbers are all
real.
