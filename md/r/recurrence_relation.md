A formula which defines a sequence of numbers by telling you how to get
from one number to the next. For instance the Fibonacci numbers f(n) are
defined by the recurrence relation f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) which says
that each number in the sequence is equal to the sun of the two previous
ones.

Sometimes we can find ways to turn a recurrence relation into an
ordinary formula which gives f(n) in terms of n, but this is not always
easy.
