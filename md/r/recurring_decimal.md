A decimal in which the same pattern of digits repeats over and over
again;

eg one ninth = 0.111111...

one seventh = 0.142857142857....

Sometimes we write recurring decimals by writing out the repeating
pattern once and putting a dot over the first and last digit of it,

eg $ \frac{1}{9} = 0.\dot{1} $

$ \frac{1}{7} = 0.\dot{1}4285\dot{7} $

but this notation is becoming less common.
