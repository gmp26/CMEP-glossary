Given a vector ${\mathbf{a}}$ and a direction vector ${\mathbf{u}}$, we
can write ${\mathbf{a}}$ as the sum of a part in the direction of
${\mathbf{u}}$ and a part in another direction. The part in the
direction of ${\mathbf{u}}$ is called the resolved part of
${\mathbf{a}}$ in direction ${\mathbf{u}}$.

It is given by $$\frac{{\mathbf{a}}.{\mathbf{u}}}{|{\mathbf{u}}|}.$$
