To reduce something is to make it less. In the Sales at the shops items
are often reduced. Money is taken off the original prices, items cost
less. To sell goods, shopkeepers often offer a fixed amount that is
taken off all purchases - say £5, everything costs £5 less. Occasionally
they reduce goods by a fixed percentage, say 10% or a 1/10, that is, ten
pence in every pound is taken off the cost.
