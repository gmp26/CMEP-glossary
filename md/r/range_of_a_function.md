The set of possible values in which a functionâ€™s output can be.

If every single member of the range is a possible value of the function,
then the function is called surjective. This is not always the case; it
depends on what we consider to be the range of the function, for
instance the squaring operation acting on the integers is surjective if
we think of the range as just the positive integers, but not if we think
of the range as all the integers.
