A method for the numerical solution of first order differential
equations: given equation $ \frac{dy}{dx} = f(x,y) $ and a starting
point $x_{0}, y_{0}, values of y_{i+1}$ for $x_{i}=x_{i}+h$ are given
approximately by $$y_{i+1}=y_{r}+(k_{1}+k_{2})/2,$$ where
$k_{1}=hf(x_{i}, y_{i})$, and $k_{2}=hf(x_{i}+h, y_{i}+k_{1}).$
