This means how fast something changes over time.

For instance, the rate of change of position is how far something moves
during one unit of time. We can work this out by dividing the distance
moved by the time taken, to find the average rate of change of position.
If the length of time we consider gets smaller and smaller, the average
rate of change will tend towards what is called an instantaneous rate of
change; how fast a quantity is changing at a particular instant. The
rate of change of position is normally referred to as velocity or speed.

We can have rates of change of lots of things, like length, volume,
height, speed, etc.
