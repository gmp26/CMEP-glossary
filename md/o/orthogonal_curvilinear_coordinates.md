A coordinate system for $ n $ -dimensional space defined by specifying
$ n $ orthogonal vectors, which are in general functions of position.
Given these vectors, the components of a given point are the calculated
in the usual manner. Common examples are Cartesian coordinates,
cylindrical polar coordinates and spherical polar coordinates.
