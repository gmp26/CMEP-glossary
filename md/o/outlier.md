A member of a data set which is different in some way from the general
pattern, is called an outlier. For instance, in <span>0, 1, -1, 3, -2,
103</span>, 103 is an outlier. An outlier may indicate that there was an
error in the process which produced the data, or it may show there is a
real abnormality in the system which we are studying.
