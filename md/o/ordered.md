A set is ordered if it can have a transitive relation $<$ defined on it
so that any two distinct elements of the set $x$ and $y$ either satisfy
$x < y$ or $x > y$. This enables us to place any pair of elements in a
definite order, and hence to place the entire set in order. The real
numbers are ordered, but the complex numbers are not.
