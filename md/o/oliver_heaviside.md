Oliver Heaviside (1850-1925): an English mathematician, who is
remembered mainly for the Heaviside step function, named after him. In
fact he is responsible also for the equations which we call Maxwell’s
equations and did important work on vector analysis and operational
calculus.

The conducting layer in the earth’s atmosphere which allows radio waves
to follow the curvature of the earth, is named the Heaviside layer; its
existence was predicted by him.
