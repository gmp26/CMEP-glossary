The act of combining elements of a set.

Multiplying, dividing, adding and subtracting are specific operations
used on the set of numbers. Two numbers can be combined using one of
these operations to produce a third number.

Using the numbers 8 and 2:

multiplying them produces 16;

dividing them produces 4(or a quarter);

adding them produces 10;

while subtracting them produces 6 (or -6, negative six).

The order of doing operations on numbers is very important.
