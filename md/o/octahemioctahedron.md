The 8th uniform polyhedron is the Octahemioctahedron; it has Wythoff
symbol 3/2 3|3. Its dual is the octahemioctacron. The pattern of
polygons round each vertex is (6,3/2,6,3); its symmetry group is the
tetrahedral group A4.

It has:

Euler characteristic: 0

It is two-sided; it has

Number of vertices: 12

Number of edges: 24

Number of faces: 12 (=4 hexagons and 4 triangles and 4<span>3/2</span>).

Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining
every $b^{th}$ of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made
by taking five points and joining every second point.
