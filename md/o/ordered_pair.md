A pair of numbers, where the order of them is important. They are
written with brackets around them, e.g. (4, 3).

They are often used to locate a specific point on a map or a graph.

e.g. (5, 8) - this means a point which is both 5 units to the right and
8 units up, and is different from the point (8, 5).
