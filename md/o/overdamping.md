A damped harmonic system $ \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} + \alpha \frac{dx}{dt} 
+ \omega ^2 x = 0  $ is described as overdamped if
$ \alpha > 2 \omega . $

In this case the equation is solved by $ x = A e ^{mt} + B e ^{nt} $
where m and n are the roots of the auxiliary equation.

The system does not oscillate at all; it simply returns to the
equilibrium position and stays there.
