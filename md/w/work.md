Work is the integral of force with respect to position, or the integral
of energy with respect to time.

If f(x) is the force exerted on a particle when it is at position x,
then the work done by this force as the particle moves along a given
path is the integral of f.dx along that path.

Work has dimensions $ML^{2}T^{-2}$ and SI unit J.
