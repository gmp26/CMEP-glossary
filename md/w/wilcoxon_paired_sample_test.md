A test of the null hypothesis that two paired samples drawn from
similarly-shaped distribution are drawn from the *same* distribution,
against the alternative hypothesis that the populations have different
locations.

The samples $x_{i}, y_{i}$ give values $d_{i}=x_{i}-y_{i}$; the
$|d_{i}|$ are ranked. P and Q are respectively the sums of ranks for
positive and negative $d_{i}.$ The test statistic is
$T=\mathrm{min}[P,Q]$. Tables are given for use with this test.
