A test of the null hypothesis that a population distribution is
symmetrical about M. It makes no other assumptions about the
distribution.

We test by ranking values of $|x_{i}-M|;$ P and Q are respectively the
sums of ranks for $x_{i}$ greater or smaller than M. The test statistic
is T=min[P,Q]. Tables are given for use with this test.
