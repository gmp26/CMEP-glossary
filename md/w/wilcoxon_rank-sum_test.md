This is a test of the null hypothesis that two samples drawn from
similarly-shaped distribution are drawn from the *same* distribution,
against the alternative hypothesis that the populations have different
locations.

The sample statistic is $W$, equal to the sum of ranks of the smaller
sample. Tables are given for use with this test.
