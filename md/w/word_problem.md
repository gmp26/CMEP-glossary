A mathematical problem that is stated in words rather than in symbols or
as an equation. There are a lot of different types of ’standard’ word
problem. Often the first thing we must do with such a problem is to turn
it into one with symbols or an equation, instead of words.

Eg ’If it takes two caterpillars three days to eat five leaves, how many
days would it take eight caterpillars to eat fifteen leaves?’
