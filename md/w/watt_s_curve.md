Given two wheels, each with radius $b$, with their centres a distance
$2a$ apart, and a rod of length $2c$ fixed to the circumference of one
wheel at each end, then the locus of the midpoint of the rod as one of
the wheels rotates is called Wattâ€™s curve. It has polar equation
$$r^2 = b^2 - [ a\sin( \theta ) \pm \sqrt{c^2 - a^2\cos^2\theta}]^2 .$$
