To test whether two sets of data are likely to be from the same
population, we put the two sets of data together into rank order, and
then replace each piece of data with its rank. Then we find the sum of
the ranks of the data from one of the original sets.

Tables of critical values for various sizes of samples are published.

For example, if the two sets of data were: A: <span>1, 3, 5, 4, 6, 2,
7</span> and B: <span>3, 6, 7, 4, 8, 4</span> then we would rank them as
follows: 1(A), 2(A), 3(A), 3(B), 4(A), 4(B), 4(B), 5(A), 6(A), 6(B),
7(A), 7(B), 8(B). Replacing each number with its rank gives: 1(A), 2(A),
3(A), 4(B), 5(A), 6(B), 7(B), 8(A), 9(A), 10(B), 11(A), 12(B), 13(B).

Then we find the sum of the ranks of the values from A:
1+2+3+5+8+9+11=39; we would compare this with a published critical
value.
