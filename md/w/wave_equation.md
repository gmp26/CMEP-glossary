In one dimension,
$$\frac{1}{{c}^2} \frac{\partial ^2 {f}}{\partial {t}^2}
= \frac{\partial ^2 {f}}{\partial {x} ^2 }$$ where t is time and x is a
space co-ordinate. c is the wave speed. This equation describes, for
instance, the displacement of a vibrating string at different positions
along its length and at different times.
