For a given number: arrange its digits in ascending order - call this m.
Arrange the digits in descending order - call this n. Compute n-m.
Repeat the process with this new starting number.

For all 3-digit starting points, 495 is eventually reached, where the
process stops.

For 4-digit starting points, 6174 is reached. Numbers whose digits are
all equal are exceptions.

For 5-digit starting points, one of three cycles is reached; not a fixed
number.
