In information theory: given strictly positive integers
$ s_1, \ldots,s_m $ , there is a decipherable code with codewords of
lengths $ s_1, \ldots,s_m $ composed of letters from an alphabet of
length $ a $ iff $$\sum_{i=1}^m a^{-s_i} \leq 1;$$ if this condition
holds there is also a prefix-free code with codewords of these lengths.
