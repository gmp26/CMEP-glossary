Three laws to do with the movement of planets around the sun:

I: a planet’s orbit is an ellipse, with the sun at one focus;

II: the line joining the planet to the sun sweeps out equal areas in
equal times;

III: the cube of the major axis of the ellipse is proportional to the
square of the orbit’s period.
