k is used to denote the unit vector in the z direction: $ x = \left ( 
\begin{array}{c} 
  0 \\ 
  1 \\ 
  0 
\end{array} 
\right ) . $

It can also denote the stiffness of a body.

Small k is also used as an abbreviation for kilo, meaning one thousand -
so for instance 1g means one gram, but 1kg means one kilogram, i.e. 1000
grams.
