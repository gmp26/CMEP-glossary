A figure a little like the Möbius strip, but in three dimensions; it is
a bottle with its neck stretched out, twisted round in a fourth
dimension and reattached to the bottle from the inside, so that the
inside and outside of the bottle are actually the same (the Möbius strip
has its front and back the same).
