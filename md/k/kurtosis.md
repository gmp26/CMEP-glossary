For a given frequency function, the kurtosis is a measure of how sharply
the function peaks around its mode.

The coefficient of kurtosis is a quantitative measure of the kurtosis;
it is $ \gamma_2 = \frac{\mu_4}{\mu_2 ^2 } - 3 , $ where $ \mu_i $ is
the $i^{th}$ moment of the function about its mean.
