The square roots of 9 are 3 and -3.

The square roots of 4 are 2 and -2.

The square roots of 1 are 1 and -1.

We notice that -1 and other negative numbers donâ€™t have square roots.
But sometimes it would be very useful if every number had a square root.

So we imagine that there is a number, called i, which is defined by
saying that when you square it you get -1.

So then the square roots of -1 are i and -i.

The square roots of -4 are 2i and -2i.

etc.

We call i, 2i, etc. imaginary numbers, and we say that they lie along a
number line like the ordinary, real, number line, but at right angles to
it. These two number lines together form a plane called the complex
plane.
