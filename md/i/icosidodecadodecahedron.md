The 49th uniform polyhedron is the Icosidodecadodecahedron; it has
Wythoff symbol 5/3 5|3. Its dual is the medial icosacronic
hexecontahedron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is
(6,5/3,6,5); its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.

It has:

Euler characteristic: -16

Density: 4

Number of vertices: 60

Number of edges: 120

Number of faces: 44 (=20 hexagons and 12 pentagons and
12<span>5/3</span>).

Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining
every $b^{th}$ of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made
by taking five points and joining every second point.
