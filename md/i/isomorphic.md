Two groups are said to be isomorphic if there is an isomorphism between
them, i.e. a bijective map which preserves the groupsâ€™ multiplication
table completely.

In other words, G and H are isomorphic if there exists a bijective
function f from G to H with the property that: for all p and q in G,
f(pq)=f(p)f(q).

Groups which are isomorphic are the same for most practical purposes.
