A relation $\sim$ is intransitive if it is not transitive, i.e. $a
  \sim b$ and $b \sim c$ together do not necessarily imply $a \sim c$.
This is most easily seen in something like a sports league, where we may
have $A$ beats $B$, $B$ beats $C$, but then $A$ doesnâ€™t necessarily beat
$C$ - so beating is intransitive.
