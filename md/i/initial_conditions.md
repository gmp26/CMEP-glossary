Often when we have an equation to solve, we are also given a set of
initial conditions, because the equation on its own is not enough to
determine completely a systemâ€™s behaviour.

For instance, a pendulum is governed by the same equation all the time,
but in order to know what it does in a particular case we have to know
where it started.
