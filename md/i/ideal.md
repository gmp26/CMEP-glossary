A non-empty subset $ I $ of a ring $ R $ that satisfies

$ x,y \in I \implies x-y \in I $ (i.e. $ (I,+) $ is a subgroup of
$ (R,+)  ;$

$ x \in I, r \in R \implies rx \in I  . $

Equivalently, there is a ring homomorphism from $ R $ which has $ I $ as
its kernel. Note that this is only itself a ring if it contains $1$ , in
which case it is in fact equal to $ R $ by the second property. A
nonstandard notation for ”$ I $ is an ideal in $ R $” is
$ I \triangleleft R $ . An ideal $ M $ is maximal in $ R $ if item
$ M \neq R $ (i.e. $ 1 \notin M $ ) item
$ M \subseteq I \triangleleft R  \implies I=M  \text{ or } I=R $ .
Equivalently, $ M $ is maximal iff $ R/M $ is a field. An ideal $ P $ is
prime in $ R $ if

$ 1 \notin P  ; $

$ ab \in P \implies a \in P  \text{ or } b \in P . $

Note that $ a \in R $ is prime (sense 1) iff $ a \neq 0 $ and $ (a) $ is
a prime ideal. See also see principal ideal domain.
