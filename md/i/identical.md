Two geometric objects are identical if one can be turned into the other
simply by a rotation; in two dimensions if the objects are
two-dimensional, in three dimensions if the objects are
three-dimensional.

So for 3D objects, identical means the same as congruent; but in 2D, two
figures may be congruent but not identical if they are mirror images of
one another and so one cannot be rotated onto the other.
