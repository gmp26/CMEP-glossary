There are many rules which can help to integrate complicated functions;
although not all functions can be integrated at all. Examples are
integration by partial fractions, which can help to integrate fractions,
and integration by parts, which can help to integrate products of
functions.

There are also rules which can allow us to find approximate values for
integrals; methods of numerical integration.
