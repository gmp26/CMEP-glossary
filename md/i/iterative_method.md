To iterate is to perform the same procedure over and over again.
Sometimes we can solve equations approximately by iteration, for
example:

$$\begin{aligned}
  x^2 + x &=& 5 \\
  \Rightarrow x &=& \sqrt{5- x}, \\
  \mbox{so, let} x_{n} &=& \sqrt{5- x_{n-1}}\end{aligned}$$

Then, if we take as our first guess $x_{0}=1,$ we get:

$$\begin{aligned}
x_{1}&=&2\\
x_{2}&=&1.7320508\\
x_{3}&=&1.807747\\
x_{4}&=&1.7866877\\
\vdots\end{aligned}$$

The exact answer is about 1.7912878.
