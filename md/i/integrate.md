To find a formula for the area under the graph of a particular function.

Integration is the inverse operation of differentiation; some functions
can be integrated easily because of this, but often we have to split the
function up, or use a substitution, or write it in some other different
way, in order to see what to do. Some functions cannot be integrated
exactly at all, and then we have to use numerical approximations to find
the area under their graph.
