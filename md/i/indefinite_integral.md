An integral that does not have definite limits or end-points. The result
of this kind of integration is a formula, not a particular number; and
the formula will have an unknown constant in it.

If the indefinite integral of the function $f(x)$ with respect to $x$
exists, it can be written as:
$$\int f(x) \mathrm{d}x = F(x) + C \mbox{, for some constant }C.$$
