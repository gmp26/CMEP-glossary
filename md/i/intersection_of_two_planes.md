Two planes that are not parallel intersect in a line.

If the two planes have normals ${\mathbf{m}}$ and ${\mathbf{n}}$, their
vector equations are ${\mathbf{m}}.{\mathbf{r}}=c$ and
${\mathbf{n}}.{\mathbf{r}}=d$ for $c,d \in \mathbb{R}$. The angle
$\alpha$ between the two planes is the same as the angle between their
normals, and can be calculated using from
${\mathbf{m}}.{\mathbf{n}} = |m||n|\cos \alpha$.

The cross product of the normals ${\mathbf{m}} \times {\mathbf{n}}$
gives a vector at right angles to both and therefore in the direction of
the line of intersection of the planes.

Choosing a point ${\mathbf{a}}$ lying on the line of intersection, we
can then write down the equation of this line:
$${\mathbf{r}} = {\mathbf{a}} + t{\mathbf{m}} \times {\mathbf{n}} \,\mbox{where } t \in \mathbb{R}$$
