The 65th uniform polyhedron is the Inverted snub dodecadodecahedron; it
has Wythoff symbol |5/3 2 5. Its dual is the medial inverted pentagonal
hexecontahedron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is
(3,5/3,3,3,5); its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.

It has:

Euler characteristic: -6

Density: 9

Number of vertices: 60

Number of edges: 150

Number of faces: 84 (=12 pentagons and 60 triangles and
12<span>5/3</span>).

Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining
every $b^{th}$ of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made
by taking five points and joining every second point.
