A statement about two numbers or quantities that are being compared.

The statement will tell you that they are not equal and which number or
quantity is greater or smaller.

Special symbols are used to write about things that are equal (=), those
that are greater than (\>), or those that are less than (\<) other
things.

E.g. 8\<9; 7\>5; 12\<15
