A line and a plane which are not parallel intersect in a point.

If the equations of the line are $x=pz+d$, $y=qz+e$, and the equation of
the plane is $z=mx+ny+c$, then the point of intersection is at:

$$\begin{aligned}
x&=&\frac{d-nqd+nep+cp}{1-mp-nq}\\
y&=&\frac{e-mpe+mdq+cq}{1-mp-nq}\\
z&=&\frac{md+ne+c}{1-mp-nq}.\end{aligned}$$
