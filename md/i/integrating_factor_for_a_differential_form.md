A function g(x,y) is an integrating factor for a given differential form
P(x,y)dx+Q(x,y)dy if gPdx+gQdy is an exact differential. This is the
case if and only if
$ \frac{\partial}{\partial \mathrm{y}} ( \mathrm{gP} )
= \frac{\partial}{\partial \mathrm{x}} ( \mathrm{gQ} ) . $

An integrating factor for a given differential form is not in general
unique.
