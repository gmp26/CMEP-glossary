The 50th uniform polyhedron is the Icositruncated dodecadodecahedron; it
has Wythoff symbol 5/3 3 5|. Its dual is the tridyakisicosahedron. The
pattern of polygons round each vertex is (10/3,6,10); its symmetry group
is the icosahedral group A5.

It has:

Euler characteristic: -16

Density: 4

Number of vertices: 120

Number of edges: 180

Number of faces: 44 (=12<span>10</span>and 20 hexagons and
12<span>10/3</span>).

Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining
every $b^{th}$ of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made
by taking five points and joining every second point.
