A ring $ R \neq 0 $ is an integral domain (or just a domain) if $ R $
has no zero divisors, i.e. if $ xy \neq 0 $ for all $ 0 \neq x,y \in R $
. For example, every field is an integral domain, as are $  \mathbb{Z} $
and $  \mathbb{Z}[i]= {x+yi \mid x,y \in  \mathbb{Z} } $ (which are not
fields). Also observe that every **finite** integral domain is a field.
