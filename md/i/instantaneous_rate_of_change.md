If a quantity is changing over time, we can find how fast it is changing
by measuring the change over a period of time, and dividing by the
length of the time interval. If we let the interval of time get smaller
and smaller, we can find out how fast the quantity is changing at one
single instant; the instantaneous rate of change.
