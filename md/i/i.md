The first imaginary number; it is defined by saying that $i^2 = -1$.
Note that because $i$ does not lie on the real number line, it is
neither greater than nor less than 1. $\vec{i}$ is also used to denote
the unit vector in the x direction: $
x = \left( 
\begin{array}{c} 
  1 \\ 0 
\end{array} 
\right ) $ in two dimensions or $ x = \left ( 
\begin{array}{c} 
  1 \\
  0 \\
  0 
\end{array}
\right ) $ in three dimensions. Capital I is used to denote the identity
mapping, or the identity matrix.
