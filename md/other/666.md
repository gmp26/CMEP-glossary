In the book of Revelation in the Bible, the number 666 is called the
number of the Beast. In the middle ages it was quite common to try to
show that a particular person was evil by taking the numbers from the
letters in his name (eg A=1, B=2, etc) and trying to make 666 from them
by some calculation. As with many things in the middle ages, it all got
rather silly, though at some times and places numerology like this was
taken very seriously.
