The symbols [] are called braces; they may be used is the same way as ()
parentheses, to indicate that part of an expression should be evaluated
before the rest of the expression.

They may also be used to denote a closed interval: [0,1] means the set
$ \{ x : 0 \leq x \leq 1 \} , $ i.e. the set of numbers between 0 and 1,
including 0 and 1.
