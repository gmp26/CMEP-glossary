$n!$ means $n\times (n-1)\times (n-2)\times \dots \times 2 \times 1$.
This is called $n$ *factorial* or the *factorial* of $n$. It becomes
very large as $n$ gets bigger. Note that we take $0!=1$.

$$\begin{aligned}
  0! & = & 1;\\
  1! & = & 1;\\
  2! & = & 2;\\
  3! & = & 6;\\
  4! & = & 24;\\
  5! & = & 120;\\
  6! & = & 720;
  \end{aligned}$$

etc.
