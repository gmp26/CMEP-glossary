A four-dimensional polytope; i.e. a 4-dimensional figure analogous to a
polyhedron.

There are six regular 4-polytopes; the pentatope, 16-cell, tesseract,
24-cell, 600-cell and 120-cell. There are also ten stellated regular
4-polytopes.

They obey the relationship V+F=E+C, where V, F, E, C are the number of
vertices, faces, edges and cells. A cell is kind of 3-dimensional
’face’, eg the cells of a regular tesseract are cubes.
