A straight line to which a given curve eventually gets as close as we like, and stays close.

For example:

 - For the graph of $y=\frac{1}{x}$, the $x$-axis is an asymptote as $x$ tends towards $\infty$ and the $y$-axis is an asymptote as $x$ gets very close to zero.

 - For the graph $y=\ln(x)$, the $y$-axis is an asymptote as $x$ tends towards $-\infty$.
