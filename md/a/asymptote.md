A straight line to which a given curve eventually gets as close as we like, and stays close.

For example:

*   For the graph of $y=\frac{1}{x}$, the $x$-axis is an asymptote as $x$ tends towards $\infty$ and the $y$-axis is an asymptote as $x$ gets very close to zero.

*   For the graph $y=\ln(x)$, the $y$-axis is an asymptote as $x$ tends towards $-\infty$.

*   For the graph $y=2$, the line $y=2$ is an asymptote as $x$ tends
    towards $\infty$.

*   For the graph $y=(\sin x)/x$, the $x$-axis is an asymptote as $x$
    tends towards $\infty$, even though the graph crosses the $x$-axis
    infinitely often.
