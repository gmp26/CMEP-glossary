Something is ambiguous if it is not clear exactly what it means. For
instance:

’Do not think killing the king is good’ could mean either:

’Do not think that it is good to kill the king’

Or: ’Don’t worry about it; killing the king is a good idea’.

In mathematics we try to avoid ambiguity as much as possible, and use
special notation, signs and symbols to make things clear.
