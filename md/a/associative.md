An operation is associative if, when the operation appears twice in an
expression, it doesnâ€™t matter where you put the brackets.

For instance, addition is associative because $$(a+b)+c \equiv a+(b+c)$$
This is called the associative law. Multiplication is associative
because $$(a b)c \equiv a(b c)$$ Division and subtraction are not
associative since $$(a-b)-c \not \equiv a - (b-c)$$ and
$$\frac{\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)}{c} \not \equiv \frac{a}{\left(\frac{b}{c}\right)}$$
