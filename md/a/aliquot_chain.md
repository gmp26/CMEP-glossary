For a given number, we can form an aliquot sequence by summing the
numberâ€™s divisors (excluding itself) to form a new number, and then
repeating this process indefinitely.

For some starting numbers the aliquot sequence will eventually cycle
(such a cycle is called a sociable chain), for some it will increase,
apparently forever. It is not known whether any aliquot sequences
actually increase without limit.

For example, it is not known what the aliquot chain starting at 276 does
in the long run.
