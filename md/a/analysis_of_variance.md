A test of the null hypothesis that k samples are taken from populations
with the same mean. The populations are assumed to be normal and have a
common unknown variance.

The distribution used is F with parameters k-1, n-k, where n is the
total sample size. The test statistic is
$$\frac{\left ( \frac{\sum _i n_i ( \bar{x_i} - \bar{x} ) ^2}{k-1} \right ) }
{\left (  \frac{\sum _i \sum _j ( x_{ij} - \bar{x_i} ) ^2}{n-k} \right ) } ,$$
where $ x_{ij} $ is the jth element of sample i, $ \bar{x_i} $ is the
mean of sample i, $ n_i $ is the size of sample i and $ \bar{x} $ is the
mean taken over all samples.
