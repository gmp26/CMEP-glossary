A certain set of paper sizes in common use are called the A-series and
designated A4, A3, etc. They are defined as follows:

Each paper size is a rectangle with its sides in the ratio
$ 1 : \sqrt{2} . $ A0 has area $1m^{2},$ A1 half of this, A2 a quarter,
etc.

So the sizes are:

A0 = 841 x 1189 mm;

A1 = 594 x 841 mm;

A2 = 420 x 594 mm;

A3 = 297 x 420 mm;

A4 = 210 x 297 mm;

A5 = 148 x 210 mm;

A6 = 105 x 148 mm;

A7 = 74 x 105 mm;

A8 = 52 x 74 mm;

A9 = 37 x 52 mm;

A10 = 26 x 37 mm.

Paper size A*n* has width $2^\frac{-1-2n}{4}$m and height
$2^\frac{1-2n}{4}$m; the sizes are rounded down to ensure that two A4
sheets are slightly smaller than one A3 sheet, etc.
