A group in which the result of applying the group operation to two group elements does not depend on their order: $$f * g = g *f$$ for every $f$ and $g$ in the group. A group with this property can also be called a commutative group. For example, all cyclic groups are Abelian (but an Abelian group is not necessarily cyclic). 

Note that additive notation is sometimes used instead of the usual multiplicative notation.

Also, every finite Abelian group is isomorphic to a group of the form $$\mathbb{Z}^ k \oplus \mathbb{Z}_{d_1} \oplus \ldots \oplus \mathbb{Z}_{d_n},$$ where $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ is the set of integers modulo $n$, $ d_1| \ldots|d_n$, and $k \ge 0$. This is known as the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups.
