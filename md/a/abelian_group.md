A group with a commutative operation; for example, all cyclic groups are
Abelian. Note that additive notation is often used in place of the more
usual group multiplication, so that $ g.h $ becomes $ g+h $ , and
$ a^k $ becomes $ ka $ (where $ k \in  \mathbb{Z}  $ ). In fact, every
Abelian group is isomorphic to a group of the form
$$\mathbb{Z}^ k \oplus \mathbb{Z}/ d_1 \mathbb{Z}  \oplus \ldots \oplus \mathbb{Z}/ d_n \mathbb{Z}$$
where $ d_1| \ldots|d_n $ . This is equivalent to the Chinese remainder
theorem (possibly only for finite groups).
