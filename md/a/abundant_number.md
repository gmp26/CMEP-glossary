An abundant number, or excessive number, is a number which is smaller than the sum of its proper divisors (a proper divisor of a number $n$ is a positive divisor of $n$ that is not $n$ itself). The amount by which the sum exceeds the number is called the abundance. 

The integer $12$ is the first abundant number. Its proper divisors are $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$ and $6$, giving a total of $16$, and therefore $12$ has an abundance of $4$.
