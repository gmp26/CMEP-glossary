There are different area formulas for different types of triangle. If we
know the lengths of all three sides we can use Heronâ€™s formula; if we
know the length of the base $b$ and the perpendicular height $h$ then
the area is $\frac{bh}{2}$; if the triangle is a right-angled triangle
and we know the lengths of the two shorter sides, then the area is half
the product of these two lengths. if we know two sides $a$,$b$ and the
angle between them, $C$, then the area is $\frac{ab}{2} \sin(C)$.
