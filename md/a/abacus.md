An ancient device used for counting. It was widely used by the Greeks
and Romans who moved stones on a flat table marked with lines to show
ones, tens, hundreds and so on. Nowadays it is used in some Eastern
countries with beads sliding on horizontal wires. Counting frames are
still used in many British schools today.
