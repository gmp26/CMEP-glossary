Jean Robert Argand (1768-1822): A Swiss mathematician. He is remembered
for his geometrical interpretation of the complex numbers, where i is
interpreted as a rotation through $90^\circ$, and for the concept of the
modulus of a complex number. His best work was on the fundamental
theorem of algebra.
