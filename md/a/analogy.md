Often, particularly in informal arguments, we can learn about something
by making an analogy with something else, i.e. saying that the two
things are alike in certain ways. For instance there is an analogy
between painting a picture and writing a book - the two activities are
very different, but they also have a lot in common, which means that
sometimes what we know about one of them can be applied to the other.
