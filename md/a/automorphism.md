A mapping $f$ from a set $S$ onto itself, that preserves all algebraic
operations that are allowed on that set. Given $a,b,c,d \in S$ with
$a=bc+d$ then $f(a), f(b), f(c), f(d) \in S
$ and $f(a)=f(b)f(c)+f(d)$. An automorphism is an isomorphism from a set
onto itself. The set of all automorphisms on a particular set, together
with the operation of composition of mappings, forms a group.
