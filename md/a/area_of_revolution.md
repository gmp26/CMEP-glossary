If the curve $y=f(x), x \in [a,b]$ is rotated by $360^{\circ}$ about the
$x$-axis, then the surface formed has area
$$2 \pi \int_a^b f(t) \sqrt {1
+ \left (f'(t)\right ) ^2 } dt .$$

Similarly, if the curve $x=g(y), y \in [p,q]$ is rotated by
$360^{\circ}$ about the $y$-axis, then the surface formed has area
$$2 \pi \int_p^q g(t) \sqrt  {1 
+ \left ( g'(t) \right ) ^2} dt .$$
