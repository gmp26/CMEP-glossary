August MÃ¶bius (1790-1868) was a German mathematician, now remembered
mainly for the MÃ¶bius strip which is named after him. He worked in
astronomy as well as trigonometrical equations, geometry and projective
geometry. The MÃ¶bius transformation is named after him.

He was interested in topology, and worked on questions to do with
map-colouring, although the MÃ¶bius strip was in fact discovered by a
mathematician named Listing.
