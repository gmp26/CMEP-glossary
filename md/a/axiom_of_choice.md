For any set $S$ there is a function $f$ with the property that if $X$ is
a nonempty subset of $S$, then $f(X)$ is in $X$. This means that $f$
(called the ’choice function’) effectively chooses an element from the
set on which it acts. This axiom is independent of and consistent with
the other axioms of set theory, but is often thought to be
counterintuitive (in this respect it is like the parallel postulate in
geometry).
