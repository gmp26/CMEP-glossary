A function $f$ is automorphic with respect to a given group of
transformations, in a domain $D$ of the complex plane, if: $f$ is
analytic, except for poles, in $D$; if $T$ is in the given group of
transformations and $z$ is in $D$, then $T(z)$ is also in $D$, and
$f(T(z))=T(f(z))$ - i.e. each of the transformations preserves the
action of $f$.
