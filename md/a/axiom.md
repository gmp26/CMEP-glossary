Axioms are statements that form the foundation of a field of
mathematical study. A mathematical proof is simply a logical argument
that shows that a result follows from the chosen set of axioms. The
axioms themselves cannot be proved. The set of axioms must not lead to
contradictory conclusions, nor should it be possible to prove one axiom
from others in the set.
