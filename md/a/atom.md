An atom is a very small unit of matter, made up of protons and neutrons
stuck together in a lump, and electrons orbiting around. There are about
96 basic different types of atom, corresponding to the different
chemical elements.

Atoms can stick together to form molecules. The properties of atoms are
mainly electrical and magnetic.
