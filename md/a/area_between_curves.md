We can use integration to find the area between two curves in the same
way that we use it to find the area underneath one curve.

For instance, if we have two functions f(x) and g(x) and we want to find
the area between their curves in the region [a, b], and if f(x) is
always greater than g(x) in that region, then we would integrate to find
the area under the graph of f(x), and then subtract the area under the
graph of g(x).

ie, area $ A = \int_{a}^{b} f(x)dx - \int_{a}^{b} g(x)dx. $

Care must be taken if the two curves cross, or if one of them crosses
the x-axis in the required region.
