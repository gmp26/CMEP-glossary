The Apollonian gasket is constructed as follows: draw 3 touching
circles: they will enclose a ’triangle’ with curved edges. Draw another
circle inside this triangle, to touch each edge; this forms three more
triangles. Continue to draw new circles in the triangles that are
formed. The limit of this process is called the Apollonian gasket.
