A 4 by 4 antimagic square is a square arrangement of the numbers 1 to 16
so that the totals of the four rows and four columns and two long
diagonals form a sequence of ten consecutive integers.

2 by 2 and 3 by 3 antimagic squares do not exist, but there are lots of
them for larger sizes, eg:

   1    13   3    12
  ---- ---- ---- ----
   15   9    4    10
   7    2    16   8
   14   6    11   5
