A number that is the root of some polynomial equation with integer
coefficients.

So, for instance, $ \sqrt {5} + 3 $ is an algebraic number because it is
a root of $ \mathrm{x}^2 - 6 \mathrm{x} + 4 = 0, $ but $ \pi $ is not,
because it cannot be written as the root of such an equation.

A complex number may be algebraic (for instance i is a root of
$1+x^{2}=0).$

All rational numbers are algebraic, but not all real or complex numbers
are.

If a number is not algebraic, it is transcendental.
