At the beginning of a proof, we often decide that certain things are
going to be unquestionably true as far as this proof is concerned. These
things are called assumptions.

This means that we know in what circumstances the proof works. For
instance, two lines meet at a single point, assuming that they are not
parallel.

To make a ’proof by contradiction’, we start by assuming something that
we think is not true, and see if we can show that the consequences of
this are obviously wrong.
