Arithmetic mean or Mean or Average is perhaps the best known measure of
central tendency (of the location) for interval and ratio scale
variables.

Arithmetic mean is calculated by summing a set of data values and
dividing by the number of values. $$\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum x_i  .$$

Arithmetic mean is sensitive to the outlier points, but the median is
not.
