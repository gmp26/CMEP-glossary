If we draw a pair of perpendicular axes, and move a line of fixed length
so that it always touches both axes at its ends, then we will trace out
a shape called an astroid.

It has parametric equations $x=a.cos^{3}t, y=a.sin^{3}t.$

It is also the hypocycloid formed by a circle of radius a rolling inside
a circle of radius 4a.
