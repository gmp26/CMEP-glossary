You will often hear people use *acceleration* to mean *getting faster*,
and *deceleration* to mean *slowing down*. We use the accelerator pedal
on a car to go faster, and the brake in order to decelerate. The
mathematical term is a little more precise than this common usage
because it includes the idea of the *direction* of acceleration. This
may be the same as the way you are travelling – in which case you will
go faster – or it may be in the opposite (negative) direction – in which
case you will go slower. The direction of acceleration does not even
need to be in line with the direction of motion. Think of the Moon. In
what direction is it accelerating? In which direction is it moving?
