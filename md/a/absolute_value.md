In general, the absolute value (or modulus) of a number is how far that number is from the origin.

For a real number, $x$, this is the non-negative value of $x$ without regard to its sign, denoted $|x|$.

The absolute value of a complex number, $z=x+iy$, is defined as $|z|=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$. This is also known as the complex modulus.
