One of the thirteen semi-regular polyhedra, excluding the infinte
classes of prisms and antiprisms which are also semiregular.

There are thirteen such solids; some of them can be obtained by
truncating (chopping the corners off) the Platonic solids, for instance
the truncated cube is a cube which has had its corners cut off, in such
a way that the square faces become regular octagons, and the flat faces
where the corners have been removed are equilateral triangles.
