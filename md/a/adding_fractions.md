To add together two fractions, first find equivalent fractions that share a common denominator. The sum may then be found by adding the numerators. You may then want to simplify the result.

For example, to add $\frac{2}{5}$ and $\frac{3}{7}$, we find equivalent fractions that both have a common denominator of $35$. Therefore, we have
$$\frac{2}{5} + \frac{3}{7} = \frac{14}{35} + \frac{15}{35} = \frac{14 + 15}{35} = \frac{29}{35}.$$
