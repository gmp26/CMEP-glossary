Joseph-Louis Lagrange (1736-1813): French(/Italian) mathematician.

He worked on the calculus of variations, and methods of maxima and
minima, applying these methods to mechanics. He worked also on the
theory of vibrating strings, differential equations, number theory, and
fluid mechanics. He studied the three-body problem and the motion of the
solar system.

The Lagrangian function, which he introduced in the context of fluid
mechanics, bears his name.
