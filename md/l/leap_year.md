A measurement of time. It is a special year that consists of 366 days.

The extra day is always February 29th. Leap years occur every fourth
year. So having a birthday on February 29th is not a good idea. Leap
years are always the ones which will divide by 4, except those years
ending in two zeros unless their first two numbers are divisible by 4.

e.g. 1996; 1992; 1988; 1984; 1980 and 1600; 2000 are leap years,

but 1997; 1814; 1800 and 1700 are not.
