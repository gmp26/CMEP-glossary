A limaçon is formed as follows: take a fixed circle of radius a, and
roll another circle, with the same radius, around the outside of it.
Take a point P in the disc moving with the moving circle, a distance k
from the circle’s edge. The locus of P as the circle rolls, is a
limaçon.

If k=a, then we get a trisectrix, and if k=2a we get a cardioid.

The same curve can be generated as a conchoid with respect to a circle
and a point on the circle.

It is also the inverse of a conic section with respect to one of its
foci; and it is the pedal curve of a circle with respect to a point in
the plane.

It has polar equation $ \mathrm{r=k-2a.cos} \theta . $

It is named after Etienne Pascal, not his son Blaise. It is the envelope
of circles whose centres lie on a fixed circle and which pass through a
given fixed point.
