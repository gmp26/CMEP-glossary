Given a rectangular hyperbola, choose a point P on it. Draw a tangent to
the hyperbola at P. Draw a line perpendicular to the tangent, through
the origin. Call the point where this line intersects the tangent, Q.
The locus of Q is called a lemniscate.

This curve has an equation of the form:
$(x^{2}+y^{2})^{2}=a^{2}(x^{2}-y^{2}).$

In polar coordinates, it has equation
$ \mathrm{r}^2 = \mathrm{a}^2 \mathrm{cos}2 \theta. $

It is the envelope of the circles whose centres lie on a given
rectangular hyperbola and which pass through the hyperbola’s centre.

It is the inverse of the hyperbola with respect to its centre.

It is a special case of Cassini’s ovals.
