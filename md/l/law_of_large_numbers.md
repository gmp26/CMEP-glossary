In statistics: the fundamental statistical result that the average of a
sequence of $ n $ independent identically distributed random variables
tends to their common mean as $ n \to \infty  $ ; thus the relative
frequency of an event tends to its probability. See also strong law of
large numbers, weak law of large numbers.
