Any square matrix A can be written as the product of a lower triangular
matrix L and an upper triangular matrix U. This is called an LU
decomposition or LU factorisation. Eg: $$\left ( 
\begin{array}{cc} 
  2 & 3 \\
  -10 & -18 
\end{array} \right )
= \left ( 
\begin{array}{cc} 
  1 & 0 \\
  -5 & 1 
\end{array} \right )
\left ( 
\begin{array}{cc} 
  2 & 3 \\
  0 & -3 
\end{array} 
\right )$$
