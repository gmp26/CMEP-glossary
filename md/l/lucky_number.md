The sequence of Lucky numbers is constructed as follows:

take the sequence of integers (1, 2, 3, ...) and remove every 2nd
number. This gives a sequence beginning 1, 3, 5, ... Now remove every
3rd number, to get a sequence beginning 1, 3, 7, 9, 13, ... Now remove
every 7th number, etc. The numbers which remain are the Lucky numbers.
