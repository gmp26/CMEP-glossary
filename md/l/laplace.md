Pierre-Simon Laplace (1749-1827): French mathematician.

He worked on maxima and minima, difference equations, integral calculus,
and many other topics in mathematics. Astronomy and probability were
areas that he pursued throughout his life. Later in life he explored
physics, particularly the theory of heat. He made major contributions to
mechanics and celestial mechanics.

The Laplacian operator, and Laplaceâ€™s equation, are named after him.
