A limiting value is another word for the limit for a sequence or a
process.

A limiting factor is a variable which acts as the main constraint on a
system. For instance when we are deciding whether to buy something or
not there may be lots of factors involved in the decision, like how much
we want the object or what else we could do with the same amount of
money; but the limiting factor is whether or not we can afford it.
