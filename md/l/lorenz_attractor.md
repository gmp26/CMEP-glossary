A strange attractor studied by Lorenz in the context of models of
weather systems. It consists of two loops, in a configuration that has
been said to resemble a butterflyâ€™s wings; the path of a point around
the attractor switches from one loop to the other in an unpredictable
manner. It was the first strange attractor to be discovered.
