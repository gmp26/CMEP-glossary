A number in the sequence obtained when each number is equal to the sum
of the two previous ones. The first two terms are 1, 1. The start of the
Fibonacci sequence is:

1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...

(They were studied by Lam√© before Fibonacci, but the later name of
Fibonacci numbers is more often used.)

The $n^{th}$ Fibonacci number is given by
$$F_n = \frac{ (1 + \sqrt{5} ) ^n - ( 1 - \sqrt{5} ) ^n } { 2^n \sqrt{5} } ,$$
or $F_{n}$ is the nearest integer to
$$\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \left ( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5} } {2} \right ) .$$

The only triangular Fibonacci numbers are 0, 1, 3, 21, 55.

The only square Fibonacci numbers are 1 and 144.
