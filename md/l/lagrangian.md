For a given conservative dynamical system, the Lagrangian is L=T-V,
where T is the kinetic energy of the system and V is its potential
energy. L is a function of the generalised coordinates $q_{i}$ and
generalised velocities $ \dot{\mathrm{q}}_{\mathrm{i}} $ of the system.

It can be shown that the equations of motion for a conservative system
in this case are $ \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{dt}} \left (
\frac{\partial \mathrm{L}}{\partial \dot{\mathrm{q}}_{\mathrm{j}}} \right )
- \frac{\partial \mathrm{L}}{\partial \mathrm{q}_{\mathrm{j}}} = 0 . $

An analogous function can be defined, giving a similar equation of
motion, for a non-conservative system.
