Either: The sequence beginning 1, 3... in which each number is equal to
the sum of the previous two. It is closely related to the Fibonacci
sequence. Or (less usually): The sequence of numbers $u_{n}$ defined by:
$$u_{n}=4u_{n-1}-u_{n-2}.$$ Usually we take the first two values as
$u_{0}=2,$ $u_{1}=4,$ so the sequence is:
$$2, 4, 14, 52, 194, 724, 2702, 10084, 37634 ...$$ Values in this
sequence all satisfy the equation $s^{2}-3r^{2}=4$ for an integer value
of r.
