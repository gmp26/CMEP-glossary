In linear maths: A map $  \tau  : V \to W $ between vector spaces
satisfying

$  \tau (v+w)= \tau (v)+ \tau (w) $

$  \tau ( \lambda v)= \lambda  \tau (v) $

or equivalently just
$  \tau ( \lambda v+ \mu w)= \lambda  \tau (v)+ \mu  \tau (w) $ , for
all scalars $  \lambda, \mu $ and all $ v,w \in V $ . Note that $ V $
and $ W $ must be defined over the same field $\mathbf{F}$ for this to
make any sense. If $ V=W $ , $  \tau  $ is called an endomorphism.

Every linear map between finite-dimensional vector spaces corresponds to
a matrix, given an isomorphism between the vector spaces and
$  \mathbf{F}^n $ . This is done by setting the $ j $ th column of the
matrix to be the image of the $ i $ th basis vector of
$  \mathbf{F}^n \cong V $ . The kernel of $  \tau  $ is the set of all
values taken by $  \tau  $ to the zero element of $ W $ . This is
clearly a subspace of $ V $ , and similarly the image $  \tau (V) $ is a
subspace of $ W $ . The rank $  rk \tau   $ of $  \tau  $ is the
dimension of its image space (i.e. the set $  \tau (V) \subseteq W $ ).
The nullity $  null  \tau  $ is the dimension of the kernel; the
rank-nullity formula $$rk  \tau + null  \tau = dim V$$ relates these
quantities. See also n-linear, isomorphism, Jordan normal form, minimum
polynomial, characteristic polynomial, nilpotent
