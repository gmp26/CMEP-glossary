$$\nabla ^2 \mathrm{f} = 0$$ This is a special case of Poisson’s
equation. In two dimensions it is equivalent to:
$$\frac{\partial ^2 \mathrm{f}}{\partial \mathrm{x} ^2 } 
+ \frac{\partial ^2 \mathrm{f}}{\partial \mathrm{y} ^2 } =0 .$$ Very
many common functions are solutions of Laplace’s equation.
