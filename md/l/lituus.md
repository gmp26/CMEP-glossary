Given a point, and a line through it, we can pick another point P and
thus define a sector of a circle. If we then take the locus of P so that
the area of the sector remains constant, then this locus is a lituus. It
is a kind of spiral.

It has polar equation $ \mathrm{r}^2 \theta = \mathrm{a}^2 .$
