This is a system of differential equations which can be used to model
the variation of two populations of animals (predators and prey) over
time: $$\frac{\mathrm{dx}}{\mathrm{dt}} = \mathrm{gx-kxy}$$
$$\frac{\mathrm{dy}}{\mathrm{dt}} = \mathrm{ckxy-dy} ,$$

where x is the size of the prey population;

y is the size of the predator population;

g is the rate of growth of the prey population (as a fraction of the
existing population, per unit time);

k is the rate at which the predators kill the prey (kills per predator
per prey animal per unit time);

c represents the number of prey that must be consumed to make a new
predator;

is the death rate of the predator (as a proportion of the existing
population, per unit time).
