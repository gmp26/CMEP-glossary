A measurement of the distance between two points. The distance can be
measured along a straight line or a curved path. What we mean by
*straight* or *curved* is very much dependent on the kind of geometry we
are using. Common tools for measuring length are the ruler, metre stick,
trundle wheel or a tape measure. In the past, the lengths of body parts
were used to estimate length - giving us such useful units as the *foot*
and the *hand*.
