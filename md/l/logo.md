A computer language.

Logo uses instructions such as “forward 40” `(FD 40)`, “backward 20”
`(BK 20)`, “right 85” `(RT 85)` or “left 125” `(LT 125)`, to create
drawings. This ability to create graphics, combined with the power of a
complete computer language, makes it interesting in mathematics
education.

Logo is very closely related to LISP - the list processing language used
in much early Artificial Intelligence research.
