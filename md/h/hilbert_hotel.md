An imaginary hotel in which there are infinitely many rooms, numbered 1,
2, 3, 4, ...

Even if the hotel is full, one more guest can be fitted in by asking
everybody to move to the next room up, which frees up room 1.

In fact, by asking everyone to move up n rooms, you can free up the
first n rooms, and accommodate any finite number of new guests.

If a (countable) infinite number of new guests arrive, you can fit them
in by asking the person in room 1 to move to 2; the person in 2 to move
to 4, the person in 3 to move to 6, etc... This frees up all the odd
numbered rooms.

The Hilbert hotel is a good demonstration of some of the unexpected
properties of infinite sets.
