A one-sided surface whose faces are four triangles and three
quadrilaterals. It is possible to make a regular heptahedron with
equilateral triangles and squares, though as the surface encloses no
volume it is not clear whether or not it should be considered a
polyhedron.

It can be formed from alternate faces of an octahedron, together with
the octahedronâ€™s three quadrilateral cross-sections.
