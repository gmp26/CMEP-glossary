A group of functions related to the trigonometric functions:

hyperbolic sin of x is written sinh(x) (pronounced ’shine x’)

hyperbolic cos of x is written cosh(x) (’cosh x’)

hyperbolic tan of x is written tanh(x) (’tansh x’)

Definitions; sinh(x) = [exp(x) - exp(-x)]/2

cosh(x) = [exp(x) + exp(-x)]/2

tanh(x) = sinh(x)/cosh(x)

There are also sech, coth and cosech, defined as 1/cosh, 1/sinh and
1/tanh respectively.
