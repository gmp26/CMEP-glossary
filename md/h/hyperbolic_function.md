A group of functions related to the trigonometric functions:

Hyperbolic $\sin$ of $x$ is written $\sinh(x)$ (pronounced ’shine x’)

Hyperbolic $\cos$ of $x$ is written $\cosh(x)$ (’cosh x’)

Hyperbolic $\tan$ of $x$ is written $\tanh(x)$ (’tansh x’)

Definitions; 

$\sinh(x) = \frac{e^x-e^{-x}}{2}$

$\cosh(x) = \frac{e^x+e^{-x}}{2}$

$\tanh(x) = \frac{\sinh(x)}{\cosh(x)}$

There are also $\text{sech}$, $\text{cosech}$ and $\coth$, defined as $\frac{1}{\cosh}$, $\frac{1}{\sinh}$ and
$\frac{1}{\tanh}$ respectively.
