28 is a happy number because:

$28 \rightarrow 2^2 + 8^2 =  4 + 64 = 68$

$68 \rightarrow 6^2 + 8^2 = 36 + 64 = 100$

$100 \rightarrow 1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1$

Twenty eight can be reduced to 1 by the process of repeatedly squaring
and adding the digits. Thirty two is also a happy number:

$32 \rightarrow 3^2 + 2^2 = 9 + 4 = 13$

$13 \rightarrow 1^2 + 3^2 = 1 + 9 = 10$

$10 \rightarrow 1^2 + 0^2 = 1 + 0 = 1$

But 24 is a sad, unhappy number. Can you see why?
