A transformation which is useful for circularly symmetric functions,
i.e. functions which depend only on the distance from the origin. The
$n^{th}$ order Hankel transform of a function f(r) is
$$F_n (s) \equiv \int _0 ^{\infty} r f(r) J_n (rs) dr ,$$ where $J_{n}$
is an $n^{th}$ order Bessel function.

The Hankel transform of order zero is equivalent to a 2-D Fourier
transform of the same function.

The inverse of a Hankel transform is as follows:
$$f(r) \equiv \int _0 ^{\infty} sF_n (s) J_n (rs) ds .$$
