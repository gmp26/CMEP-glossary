An elastic body under tension obeys the law that the force exerted is
proportional to the extension of the body: $T=kx$, where $T$ is the
tension, $x$ the extension and $k$ the stiffness of the body.

Alternatively, the force exerted is proportional the the proportional
extension of the body:

$ T = \lambda \frac{x}{l_0} , $ where $T$ is the tension, $x$ the
extension, $l_{0}$ the initial length and $ \lambda $ the modulus of
elasticity.
