A mapping between two sets, which preserves the algebraic structure of
the domain set. i.e. if a particular algebraic relation is true in the
domain, it will be true after the mapping has been applied, in the
range.

A homomorphism between groups G and H is a map f that preserves the
group operation, i.e. if p, q are in G then f(pq)=f(p)f(q).

(Do not confuse this with homeomorphism.)
