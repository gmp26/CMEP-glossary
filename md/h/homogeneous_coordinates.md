In two dimensions, homogeneous coordinates for a point (x,y) are numbers
a,b,c with the property that x=a/c and y=b/c. Homogeneous coordinates
are defined similarly in n dimensions; there are n+1 homogeneous
coordinates.

In homogeneous coordinates the point at infinity can be described by
setting c=0.
