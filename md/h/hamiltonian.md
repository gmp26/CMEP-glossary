For a given dynamical system, described by generalised coordinates
$q_{i}$ and generalised momenta $p_{i},$ the Hamiltonian is
$ \mathrm{H} = \sum \mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{i}} \dot{\mathrm{q}}_{\mathrm{i}} - \mathrm{L} , $
where L is the Lagrangian of the system, and $ \dot{\mathrm{q}} $ is the
derivative of q with respect to time.

$(p_{i}$ are given by
$ \mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{i}} = \frac{\partial \mathrm{L}}
{\partial \dot{\mathrm{q}}_{\mathrm{i}}} . $ )

If L does not depend explicitly on time, then H is the total energy of
the system.
