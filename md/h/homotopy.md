Let $  \varphi  : [a,b] \to D $ and $  \psi  : [a,b] \to D $ be
piecewise smooth closed paths in a domain $ D $ . A homotopy from
$  \varphi  $ to $  \psi  $ is a continuous function
$  \gamma  : [a,b]^2 to D $ satisfying

$  \gamma(a,t) =  \varphi (t)   \forall t \in[a,b] $ ,

$  \gamma(b,t) =  \psi    (t)   \forall t \in[a,b] $ ,

$  \forall s \in[a,b] $ , the path $  \gamma _s(t)= \gamma (s,t) $ is
closed and piecewise smooth.

More generally, we may drop the closedness conditions.

A closed path is contractible if it is homotopic (i.e. there is a
homotopy) to a constant path. A domain $ D $ is simply connected if
every closed path is contractible.
