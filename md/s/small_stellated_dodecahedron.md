The 39th uniform polyhedron is the Small stellated dodecahedron; it has
Wythoff symbol 5|2 5/2. Its dual is the great dodecahedron. The pattern
of polygons round each vertex is (5/2,5/2,5/2,5/2,5/2); its symmetry
group is the icosahedral group A5.

It has:

Euler characteristic: -6

Density: 3

Number of vertices: 12

Number of edges: 30

Number of faces: 12 (=12<span>5/2</span>).

Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining
every $b^{th}$ of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made
by taking five points and joining every second point.
