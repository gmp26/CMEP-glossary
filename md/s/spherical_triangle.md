A spherical triangle is a region on the surface of a sphere, which is
formed by arcs of three great circles on the sphere. Each of these arcs
is less than a semicircle.

Quite a lot of results which are true for plane triangles are true for
spherical triangles, but it can often be hard to prove that this is the
case.
