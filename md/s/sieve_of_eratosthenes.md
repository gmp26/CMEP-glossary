A way of finding prime numbers; invented by Eratosthenes, a Greek
mathematician (c. 230 BC).

Take a group of numbers, and remove all those which are multiples of 2
(except 2 itself). Then remove the multiples of 3 (except 3 itself);
then the multiples of 5 (except 5), then of 7 (except 7), then of 11
(except 11), etc.

Once you have removed multiples of all primes up to the square root of
the largest number in the set, any numbers left in the set must be
primes.
