A measure of how spread out a set of data is. It is equal to the square
root of the variance.

The standard deviation is also called the root mean square deviation,
because it can be found by computing the deviation of each piece of data
from the mean, squaring each of these deviations, finding the mean of
them and then taking the square root of the mean.
