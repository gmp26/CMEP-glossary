Given a closed curve and a point, the set of all the half lines passing
through the point and the curve is called a solid angle.

The size of a solid angle is measured by considering a unit sphere
centred at the given point; the area of the region of the sphere cut by
the solid angle, is the size of the solid angle (in steradians).

The total solid angle round a point is $ 4 \pi $ steradians.
