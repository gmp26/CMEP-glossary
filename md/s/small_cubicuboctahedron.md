The 18th uniform polyhedron is the Small cubicuboctahedron; it has
Wythoff symbol 3/2 4|4. Its dual is the small hexacronic
icositetrahedron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is
(8,3/2,8,4); its symmetry group is the octahedral group S4.

It has:

Euler characteristic: -4

Density: 2

Number of vertices: 24

Number of edges: 48

Number of faces: 20 (=6 octagons and 6 quadrilaterals and
8<span>3/2</span>).

Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining
every $b^{th}$ of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made
by taking five points and joining every second point.
