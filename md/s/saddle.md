The shape of a horseâ€™s saddle is important in geometry, because when you
draw a triangle on it the angles add up to less than 180 degrees; we can
study the way geometry works on such a surface; it is part of
non-Euclidean geometry.

It is likely that space on the largest scales has this kind of shape.
