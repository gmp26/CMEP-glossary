The scalar triple product of three vectors A, B and C is A.(B $ \times $
C), which is a scalar. It is equal to |A||B||C|sin(t)cos(a), where t is
the angle between B and C and a is the angle between B $ \times $ C and
A.

It is equal to the volume of the parallelepiped of which A, B and C are
three edges.
