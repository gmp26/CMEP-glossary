If we have a standard normal variable, and a variable with a chi-squared
distribution with k degrees of freedom, then the ratio of the normal
variable to the square root of the chi-squared variable is another
random variable, which has a distribution proportional to the
t-distribution with k degrees of freedom.

This is also the same as the square root of an F-distribution with 1, k
degrees of freedom, if k\>0.

i.e. given n observations $x_{i}$ from a normal distribution with mean
$ \mu , $ we define $$\mathrm{t} = \frac{\bar{\mathrm{x}} - \mu }
{\mathrm{s} / \sqrt{\mathrm{n}}} ,$$ where
$$\mathrm{s}^2 = \sum _{\mathrm{i}=1} ^{\mathrm{n}}
\frac{ ( \mathrm{x}_{\mathrm{i}} - \bar{\mathrm{x}} ) ^{2} }
{\mathrm{n}-1} .$$ Then t has a t-distribution with n-1 degrees of
freedom.
