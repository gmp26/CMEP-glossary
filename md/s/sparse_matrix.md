A matrix which has a large proportion of its entries equal to zero. The
nonzero elements can be clustered in some way, or they could be
scattered in the matrix with no pattern. eg the following matrices would
usually be called sparse: $$\left ( 
\begin{array}{ccc} 
  1 & 0 & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & 1 
\end{array} 
\right ), \qquad 
\left ( 
\begin{array}{cccc} 
  0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
  0 & 5 & 0 & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & 0 & 0 
\end{array}
\right ) , \qquad
\left ( 
\begin{array}{ccc} 
  0 & 0 & 0 \\
  0 & 3 & 0 \\
  2 & 0 & 0 
\end{array} 
\right )$$
