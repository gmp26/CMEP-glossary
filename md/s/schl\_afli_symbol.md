A number associated with a polyhedron. For a Platonic solid, it is
written <span>p, q</span>, where p is the number of sides each face has,
and q is the number of faces which touch at each vertex.

Given this information, the number of vertices is:
$ \frac{4 \mathrm{p}}{\mathrm{4-(p-2)(q-2)}} . $

The number of edges is:
$ \frac{2 \mathrm{pq}}{\mathrm{4-(p-2)(q-2)}} . $

And the number of faces is:
$ \frac{4 \mathrm{q}}{\mathrm{4-(p-2)(q-2)}} . $
