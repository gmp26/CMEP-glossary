A snub polyhedron is a polyhedron which has pattern <span>3, p, 3, q, 3,
r</span> of polygons round each vertex.

One or two of p, q, r, may be 2, representing a ’non-face’ with two
sides. For example, the snub cube has pattern <span>2, 3, 3, 3, 4,
3</span> meaning triangle-triangle-triangle-square-triangle.

Many of these polyhedra do not have reflectional symmetry, so they have
a right-handed and a left-handed form.
