For a given number, we may be able to form a sociable chain by summing
the numberâ€™s divisors (excluding itself) to form a new number, and
repeating this process until we have returned to the original number.

This is a special case of an aliquot chain in which the chain repeats
itself forever.

An amicable pair is a sociable chain of length 2; an amicable triple is
a sociable chain of length 3.
