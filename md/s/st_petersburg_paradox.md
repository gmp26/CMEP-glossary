The following is called the St Petersburg game: We toss a coin: if it
comes up heads, we win £1 and the game ends; if tails comes up we toss
the coin again; On the second toss of the coin, if it comes up heads we
win £2 and the game ends; if tails comes up we toss the coin again; On
the third toss of the coin, if it comes up heads we win £4 and the game
ends; if tails comes up we toss the coin again; etc. The expected payoff
of this game is in fact infinite (for each outcome the payoff is
$\pounds 2^{n}$ with probability $(\frac{1}{2})^{n}$ - and there are
infinitely many outcomes). But intuitively we can see that it would not
be worth paying very much to take part in such a game. This is the St
Petersburg paradox.
