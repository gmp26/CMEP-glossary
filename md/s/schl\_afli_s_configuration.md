A line $A$, with five skew lines $V, W, X, Y, Z$ which cut $A$, and the
five unique lines (apart from $A$) each of which cuts four of
$V, W, X, Y, Z$; and the unique line cutting all of these latter five
lines. This configuration of 12 lines and 30 points, with 2 lines
through each point and 5 points on each line, is called Schläfli’s
configuration.
