The 24th uniform polyhedron is the Stellated truncated hexahedron; it
has Wythoff symbol 2 3|4/3. Its dual is the great triakisoctahedron. The
pattern of polygons round each vertex is (8/3,8/3,3); its symmetry group
is the octahedral group S4.

It has:

Euler characteristic: 2

Density: 7

Number of vertices: 24

Number of edges: 36

Number of faces: 14 (=8 triangles and 6<span>8/3</span>).

Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining
every $b^{th}$ of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made
by taking five points and joining every second point.
