A kind of oscillation for which the equation of motion is
$ \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} + \omega ^2 x = 0 . $

It occurs when a system has an equilibrium position, is subject to a
restoring force proportional to the size of the displacement from
equilibrium, and is capable of ’overshooting’ beyond the equilibrium
position. The position of the system varies sinusoidally over time, with
constant amplitude.

$ \omega $ is called the angular frequency.

The equation of motion is solved by $ x = A \sin ( \omega t )
+ B \cos ( \omega t ) , $ or by $ x = a \sin ( \omega t + \epsilon ) , $
where $ a = \sqrt{A^2 + B^2 } $ and
$ \sin \epsilon = B/a , \cos \epsilon = A/a . $

Also, $ v ^2 = \omega ^2 ( a^2 - x^2 ) , $ and the period T of the
motion is given by $ T  = \frac{ 2 \pi }{ \omega} . $
