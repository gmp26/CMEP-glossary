The 38th uniform polyhedron is the Small dodecicosidodecahedron; it has
Wythoff symbol 3/2 5|5. Its dual is the small dodecacronic
hexecontahedron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is
(10,3/2,10,5); its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.

It has:

Euler characteristic: -16

Density: 2

Number of vertices: 60

Number of edges: 120

Number of faces: 44 (=12<span>10</span>and 12 pentagons and
20<span>3/2</span>).

Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining
every $b^{th}$ of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made
by taking five points and joining every second point.
