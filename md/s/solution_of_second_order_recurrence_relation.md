The second order recurrence relation $u_{n+2}+au_{n+1}+bu_{n}=f(n)$ is
solved in a similar way to a second order differential equation. First
we solve for the complementary function
$$u_{n+2}+au_{n+1}+bu_{n}=0 (*)$$ then we construct the auxiliary
equation $$m^{2}+am+b=0,$$ which has roots $m_{1} and m_{2},$ and then
(\*) has solutions: $$\left \{ 
\begin{array}{cc} 
  u_n = Am_1 ^n + B m_2 ^n , & m_1 \neq m_2 \\
  \ u_n = (An+B)m_1 ^n , & m_1 = m_2 
\end{array}
\right .$$ The solutions to the original equation are then found by
adding a particular solution to these expressions.
