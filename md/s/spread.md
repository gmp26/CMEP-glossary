Sometimes we are interested in how widely a random variable is spread
about its mean value. Two ways to measure this are the variance and the
standard deviation.

We could try to use the average value of
$ \mathrm{X} - \langle \mathrm{X}
\rangle , $ but we find that this is always zero:
$$\langle \mathrm{X} - \langle \mathrm{X} \rangle \rangle = 
\sum _{\mathrm{i=1}} ^{ \mathrm{n}} \mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{i}} ( \mathrm{x}
_ {\mathrm{i}} - \langle \mathrm{X} \rangle )$$
$$= \sum_{\mathrm{i=1}} ^{ \mathrm{n}} \mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{i}}  \mathrm{x}
_ {\mathrm{i}} - \sum_{\mathrm{i=1}} ^{ \mathrm{n}} \mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{i}} 
\langle \mathrm{X} \rangle = \langle \mathrm{X} \rangle - \langle \mathrm{X} \rangle
 = 0$$

Instead we use measures of spread such as the average squared difference
between X and its mean.
