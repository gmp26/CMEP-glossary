A semiregular polyhedron is a polyhedron which has the same pattern
<span>p, r, q, r</span> or <span>r, q, r</span> of polygons round each
vertex, where r must be even - for instance <span>3, 4, 4, 4</span> ,
which would mean triangle-square-square.

If r=4, the case <span>r, q, r</span> represents a q-sided prism.
