The 48th uniform polyhedron is the Small ditrigonal
dodecicosidodecahedron; it has Wythoff symbol 5/3 3|5. Its dual is the
small ditrigonal dodecacronic hexecontahedron. The pattern of polygons
round each vertex is (10,5/3,10,3); its symmetry group is the
icosahedral group A5.

It has:

Euler characteristic: -16

Density: 4

Number of vertices: 60

Number of edges: 120

Number of faces: 44 (=12<span>10</span>and 20 triangles and
12<span>5/3</span>).

Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining
every $b^{th}$ of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made
by taking five points and joining every second point.
