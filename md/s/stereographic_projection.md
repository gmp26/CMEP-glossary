A way of mapping points on a sphere onto points on a plane which is
tangent to it: call O the point on the sphere which is opposite the
point of contact with the plane, then draw a line through O and any
other point X on the sphere. The image of X under the projection is the
point where the line crosses the plane.

The projection keeps angles the same.
