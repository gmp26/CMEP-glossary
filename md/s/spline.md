If we have a set of data points $(x_{i}, y_{i}),$ and we are trying to
fit a curve to them , one way to do this is to fit a polynomial curve
between each consecutive pair of points, in such a way that the two
polynomial curves meeting at any point have the same gradient at that
point.

The curve made up of these polynomial curves is called a spline.
