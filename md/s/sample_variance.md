For a sample of size n, in which value $ x_i $ occurs with frequency
$ f_i , $ the sample variance is
$$s^2 = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x} ) ^2 f_i } {n}
 = \frac{\sum x_i ^2 f_i }{n} - \bar{x} ^2$$

At a higher level, the sample variance is
$$s^2 = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x} ) ^2 f_i } {n-1} ,$$ which is an
unbiased estimate of the variance of the population from which the
sample was taken.
