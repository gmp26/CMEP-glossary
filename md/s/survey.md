A general look at something; a general examination of a situation or a
subject.

In data handling a survey is a means of collecting a sample of data. The
process usually involves four steps:

1.  deciding what subject is of interest;

2.  what questions to ask;

3.  what type of people will you ask; and

4.  exactly which people will be asked.

A survey can also mean the process of making a detailed accurate map of
a piece of land by measuring distances and angles.
