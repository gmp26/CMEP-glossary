The 35th uniform polyhedron is the Small ditrigonal icosidodecahedron;
it has Wythoff symbol 3|5/2 3. Its dual is the small triambic
icosahedron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is
(5/2,3,5/2,3,5/2,3); its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.

It has:

Euler characteristic: -8

Density: 2

Number of vertices: 20

Number of edges: 60

Number of faces: 32 (=20 triangles and 12<span>5/2</span>).

Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining
every $b^{th}$ of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made
by taking five points and joining every second point.
