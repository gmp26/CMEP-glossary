If we have a set of n elements, and we want to partition it into k
subsets each with at least one element, the number of ways to do this is
called the Stirling number of the second kind,
$ \mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{n}} ^{( \mathrm{k} ) } $ or $ \left \{ 
\begin{array}{c} 
  \mathrm{n} \\
  \mathrm{k}
\end{array} 
\right \} . $

For example if we have the set <span>1,2,3,4</span> we can partition it
into two subsets in the following ways:

<span><span>1</span>,<span>2,3,4</span></span>

<span><span>2</span>,<span>1,3,4</span></span>

<span><span>3</span>,<span>1,2,4</span></span>

<span><span>4</span>,<span>1,2,3</span></span>

<span><span>1,2</span>,<span>3,4</span></span>

<span><span>1,3</span>,<span>2,4</span></span>

<span><span>1,4</span>,<span>2,3</span></span>

So $ \mathrm{S}_4 ^{(2)} = 7 . $
