Mathematics makes liberal use of symbols to represent the objects that
form the subject of study. It is good practice to declare the meaning of
these symbols before using them, but as an aid to both writers and
readers, there are many conventions that are worth knowing and
respecting. When mathematical statements are transferred to a computer,
the symbols have to be translated in to *symbolic names*. Although the
results carry the same meaning as the original symbolic expressions,
people find them much more difficult to visualise and understand. Some
*elegance* of expression is lost in removing the symbols.
