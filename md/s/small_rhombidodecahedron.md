The 44th uniform polyhedron is the Small rhombidodecahedron; it has
Wythoff symbol 2 5/2 5|. Its dual is the small rhombidodecacron. The
pattern of polygons round each vertex is (10,4,10/9,4/3); its symmetry
group is the icosahedral group A5.

It has:

Euler characteristic: -18

It is one-sided; it has

Number of vertices: 60

Number of edges: 120

Number of faces: 42 (=6<span>10</span>and 15 quadrilaterals and
15<span>4/3</span>and 6<span>10/9</span>).

Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining
every $b^{th}$ of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made
by taking five points and joining every second point.
