If n is composite, and the sum of the digits in its prime factorisation
is equal to the sum of the digits in n, then n is a Smith number. Eg
$ 4937775 = 3 \times 5 \times 5 \times 65837,$ and
4+9+3+7+7+7+5=3+5+5+6+5+8+3+7=42. It is not known whether there are
finitely or infinitely many Smith numbers.
