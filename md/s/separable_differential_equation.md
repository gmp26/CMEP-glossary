A differential equation is called separable if it can be written as a
function of x, plus a function of y multiplied by
$ \frac{\mathrm{dy}}{\mathrm{dx}}, $ equals zero:
$$\mathrm{p(x)} + \mathrm{q(y)} \left ( \frac{\mathrm{dy}}{\mathrm{dx}} \right )
= 0$$ In this case the equation can be written:
$$\mathrm{p(x)dx} = \mathrm{-q(y)dy}$$ and we can then integrate both
sides.
