The following is called self-adjoint form for a homogeneous second-order
linear ordinary differential equation:
$$p(x)u^{\prime \prime} (x) + p^{\prime} (x)u^{\prime} (x) 
+ q(x)u(x) = 0, a \lt x \lt b .$$

The following form is equivalent:
$$\frac{d}{dx} [p(x)u^{\prime}(x)]+q(x)u(x)=0, a \lt x \lt b ,$$ with
$ p(x) > 0 $ and $ p^{\prime}(x), q(x) $ continuous in [a,b].

A linear ordinary differential operator of the following form is called
self-adjoint:
$$L = \frac{d}{dx} \left [ p(x) \frac{d}{dx} \right ] + q{x} .$$
