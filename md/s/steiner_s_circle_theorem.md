Given a fixed circle inside another fixed circle, we can construct a
chain of circles: place circle A so that it touches both of the given
circles, place circle B so that it touches both of the given circles and
A, etc.

For a particular pair of fixed circles, if the chain is closed, i.e. the
last circle touches the first, then it will be closed for any choice of
A.
