A test of the null hypothesis that the population value of a rank
correlation coefficient is zero. The test statistic is Spearmanâ€™s rank
correlation coefficient $r_{s};$ tables are given for use with this
test. We test by finding the probability corresponding to a tail that
just contains $r_{s}.$
