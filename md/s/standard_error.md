The standard error of a sample statistic is the standard deviation of
the difference between that statistic and the corresponding population
parameter. For example, if the statistic t is being used to estimate the
parameter $ \tau , $ the standard error of t is the standard deviation
of $ t - \tau . $

Unless we say otherwise, we are usually talking about the standard error
of the sample mean, which for a sample of size n is
$ \sigma / \sqrt{n} , $ where $ \sigma $ is the population standard
deviation.

Confusingly, the estimated standard error is sometimes also called the
’standard error’.
