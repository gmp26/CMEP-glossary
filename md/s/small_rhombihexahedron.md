The 23rd uniform polyhedron is the Small rhombihexahedron; it has
Wythoff symbol 3/2 2 4|. Its dual is the small rhombihexacron. The
pattern of polygons round each vertex is (8,4,8/7,4/3); its symmetry
group is the octahedral group S4.

It has:

Euler characteristic: -6

It is one-sided; it has

Number of vertices: 24

Number of edges: 48

Number of faces: 18 (=3 octagons and 6 quadrilaterals and
6<span>4/3</span>and 3<span>8/7</span>).

Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining
every $b^{th}$ of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made
by taking five points and joining every second point.
