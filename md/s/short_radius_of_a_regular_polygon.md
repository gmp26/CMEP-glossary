A regular n-gon of side length x has short radius r. To find r, consider
the triangle OAX, where O is the centre, A one vertex and X the centre
of a side next to A. We know that the interior angle of a regular n-gon
is $ 180 - \frac{360}{n}, $ so angle OAX=
$ \theta = 90 - \frac{180}{n} , $ and we have
$ \tan \theta = \frac{r}{x/2} . $

So $ r = \frac{x \tan \theta }{2} . $
