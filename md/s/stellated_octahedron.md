There is only one way to stellate a regular octahedron, equivalent to
adding a regular tetrahedron to each of its faces. The resulting figure
is called the stella octangula.

Also, if we take a cube with top face ABCD and bottom face EFGH, with A
above E, etc, then the union of the tetrahedra ACFH and BDEG is a stella
octangula.
