We say that something is symmetric, or symmetrical, if it has some kind
of symmetry. In other words, there is some transformation we can perform
on it which will leave it unchanged.

A shape is symmetrical if it is unchanged by a reflection, or a
rotation.

A matrix is symmetric if it remains the same when we reflect it about
its diagonal.
