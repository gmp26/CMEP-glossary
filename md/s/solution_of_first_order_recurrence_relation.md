The first order recurrence relation $u_{n+1}=au_{n}+f(n),$ has
solutions: $$\left \{ 
\begin{array}{cc} 
  u_n = a^n u_0,  & f(n)=0 \\
  u_n = A a^n +  v_n & f(n) \neq 0 
\end{array} 
\right .$$ where $v_{n}$ is a particular solution; unless $a=1$, in
which case $$u_n = u_0 + \sum _{i=0} ^{n-1} f(i) .$$
