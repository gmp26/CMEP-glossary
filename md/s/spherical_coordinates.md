A three-dimensional coordinate system that does not have a single
straight axis. The coordinates are: distance from the origin, and two
angles found by drawing a line from the given point to the origin and
measuring the angles formed with a given plane and a given line in that
plane.

A way to think about this is that the coordinates might be distance from
the centre of the earth, longitude, and the angular distance from the
north pole (not quite the same as latitude, but almost).
