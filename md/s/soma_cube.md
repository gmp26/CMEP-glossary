A puzzle in which a $3 \times 3 \times 3$ cube is cut up into seven
pieces and must be reassembled; there are several possible ways to
reassemble it, and various other shapes can also be made with the cube.
(The name comes from Huxleyâ€™s novel Brave New World and refers to the
dreamlike state which you enter after playing with the puzzle for too
long.)
