The 37th uniform polyhedron is the Small snub icosicosidodecahedron; it
has Wythoff symbol |5/2 3 3. Its dual is the small hexagonal
hexecontahedron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is
(3,5/2,3,3,3,3); its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.

It has:

Euler characteristic: -8

Density: 2

Number of vertices: 60

Number of edges: 180

Number of faces: 112 (=100 triangles and 12<span>5/2</span>).

Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining
every $b^{th}$ of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made
by taking five points and joining every second point.
