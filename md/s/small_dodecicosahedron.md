The 55th uniform polyhedron is the Small dodecicosahedron; it has
Wythoff symbol 3/2 3 5|. Its dual is the small dodecicosacron. The
pattern of polygons round each vertex is (10,6,10/9,6/5); its symmetry
group is the icosahedral group A5.

It has:

Euler characteristic: -28

It is one-sided; it has

Number of vertices: 60

Number of edges: 120

Number of faces: 32 (=6<span>10</span>and 10 hexagons and
10<span>6/5</span>and 6<span>10/9</span>).

Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining
every $b^{th}$ of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made
by taking five points and joining every second point.
