A theory in physics says that everything, even space itself, is made up
of loops of stuff called superstrings. All the properties of matter and
energy, space and time can be deduced from the way the superstrings
vibrate. The theory explains quite a lot, but it is hard to find
experiments that would test it, since the objects it talks about are so
small and have so much energy.
