Stefan Banach (1892-1945): A Polish mathematician. He is most often
remembered for the Banach-Tarski paradox, and for the concept of a
Banach space, which bear his name.

He worked on abstract sets, integral equations, measure theory,
functional analysis, and other areas of mathematics. His contribution to
axiomatic set theory was particularly important.
