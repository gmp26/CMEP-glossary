The 77th uniform polyhedron is the Small retrosnub
icosicosidodecahedron; it has Wythoff symbol |3/2 3/2 5/2. Its dual is
the small hexagrammic hexecontahedron. The pattern of polygons round
each vertex is (3,3/2,3,3/2,3,5/2); its symmetry group is the
icosahedral group A5.

It has:

Euler characteristic: -8

Density: 38

Number of vertices: 60

Number of edges: 180

Number of faces: 112 (=60 triangles and 12<span>5/2</span>and
40<span>3/2</span>).

Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining
every $b^{th}$ of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made
by taking five points and joining every second point.
