The square root of a given number is that number which when multiplied
by itself gives the original number. ’The square root of x’ is written
$ \sqrt {\mathrm{x}} $

e.g. The square root of nine is three or minus three:
$ \sqrt {9} = \pm 3 $

The square root of twenty five is five or minus five
$ \sqrt {25} = \pm 5 $

Not all numbers have square roots which are whole numbers.
