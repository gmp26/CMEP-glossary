Take a sphere, with its centre at O, and draw a circle C on the surface
of the sphere.

The part of the sphere bounded by C, together with the set of all lines
joining O to points on C, defines a solid called a spherical cone. It is
similar to a cone, but its base is not flat, it is part of a sphere.
