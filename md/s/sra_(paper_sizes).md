A series of standard sizes for untrimmed paper. They are slightly larger
than the corresponding A-series sizes. Printers buy untrimmed paper,
bind it and then trim it down to standard A- sizes.

The ratio of side lengths is the same as for A- series, i.e.
$ 1 : \sqrt{2} , $ and SRA0 size has area $1.15m^{2},$ SRA1 half this,
etc. So the sizes are:

SRA0= 900 $ \times $ 1280 mm;

SRA1= 640 $ \times $ 900 mm;

SRA2= 450 $ \times $ 640 mm;

SRA3= 320 $ \times $ 450 mm;

SRA4= 225 $ \times $ 320 mm.

The sizes are rounded to the nearest centimetre.
