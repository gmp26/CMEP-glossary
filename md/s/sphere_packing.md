The problem which asks, what is the most dense way to pack identical
spheres together, is unsolved. The obvious answer is to stack them in
layers, with each layer having a hexagonal pattern, and with the layers
stacked on top of one another in such a way that each sphere touches 12
others. But it has never been proved that there is no more efficient way
to do this.
