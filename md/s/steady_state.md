A situation which does not change over time.

One theory about the behaviour of the universe on the largest scale is
called the steady-state theory; it was invented by Fred Hoyle, and was a
rival to the Big Bang theory. It says that matter is not created all at
once in a Big Bang, but is created continuously at a very slow rate,
everywhere in the universe. This process is basically the same for all
time, and so the theory is called steady-state.
