The 56th uniform polyhedron is the Small dodecahemidodecahedron; it has
Wythoff symbol 5/4 5|5. Its dual is the small dodecahemidodecacron. The
pattern of polygons round each vertex is (10,5/4,10,5); its symmetry
group is the icosahedral group A5.

It has:

Euler characteristic: -12

It is one-sided; it has

Number of vertices: 30

Number of edges: 60

Number of faces: 18 (=6<span>10</span>and 6 pentagons and
6<span>5/4</span>).

Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining
every $b^{th}$ of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made
by taking five points and joining every second point.
