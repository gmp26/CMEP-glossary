Let S be a non-empty collection of sets. A non-empty subset C of S is
said to be a chain if
$ \text{for any A and B } \in \text{C, either A} \subseteq 
\text{B or B } \subseteq \text{A.} $

Suppose that whenever C is a chain in S, then
$ \bigcup_{\mathrm{D} \in \mathrm{C}} $ is an element in S. Then S
contains a maximal element.

Or, more generally, if $ \leq $ is a partial order on a non-empty set S
and every chain in S has an upper bound, then S has a maximal element.
