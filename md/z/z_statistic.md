If we take a set of data, and subtract the set’s average from each
member of the set, and then divide each member of the set by the set’s
standard deviation, then the resulting set of numbers is a set of
Z-scores (also called T-scores).

The set of Z-scores has mean 0 and standard deviation 1.

This can be a useful way to compare sets of data with different means
and standard deviations.
