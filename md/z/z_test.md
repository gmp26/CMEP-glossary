A statistical test of the null hypothesis that a population parameter
$ \mu $ is equal to a given value $ \mu _0 . $ We construct a
z-statistic for the null hypothesis, i.e. a statistic which, under the
null hypothesis, has mean zero and approximately a standard normal
distribution. Then we accept the null hypothesis if z is less than
$z_{p}$ for a one tailed test with probability p, where $z_{p}$ is the
pth percentile of the standard normal distribution.
