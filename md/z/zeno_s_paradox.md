If Achilles and a tortoise have a race, and Achilles gives the tortoise
a headstart of fifty metres, then Achilles will never catch up with the
tortoise. Why?

Because first, Achilles must get to where the tortoise started from,
point A, say - but by the time he does this the tortoise will have moved
to another point, B. So, next, Achilles must get to B. But by then, the
tortoise has got to yet another point, C. This argument can go on
forever, and Achilles will never be in the same place as the tortoise.

This is called a paradox, because reasoning which looks plausible gives
us a conclusion which is obviously wrong. Some of the ancient Greek
philosophers said that Zeno was wrong because time cannot be infinitely
subdivided; eventually the lengths of time for Achilles to get from one
point to another gets so small that they are meaningless, and the
argument cannot go on. But this doesnâ€™t quite solve the problem...

Nowadays, we can use the mathematics of geometric series to show that
the infinite number of short lengths of time add up to a finite total,
so that Achilles catches up with the tortoise after a definite length of
time.
