Daniel Bernoulli (1700-1782): A mathematician; the son of Johann
Bernoulli. He worked on probability, differential equations
(particularly the Riccati equation), vibrating systems (particularly the
vibrations of musical strings and organ pipes), the movements of fluids
(he famously studied the flow of water from a hole in a container,
obtaining the first correct description of this).
