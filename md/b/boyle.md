Robert Boyle (1627 - 1691): an Irish physicist and chemist who is
remembered for Boyle’s law, which describes an ideal gas. In a long
series of experiments with an air pump he demonstrated that sound does
not travel through a vacuum, that flames require air, and he
investigated the elastic properties of air. He recognised that a vacuum
could exist; that there was no all-pervading ’ether’ (an idea that would
not be finally discredited for nearly another three centuries).

He wrote less successfully on optics. He was a founding fellow of the
Royal Society, and was one of the first to apply mathematical techniques
to chemistry as well as physics.
