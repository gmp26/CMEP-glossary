A book is a piece of writing, occupying several pages; it may be the
physical object (the collection of pages, bound at one edge between
covers stiffer than the pages) or the text printed or written on these
pages (usually at least long enough that it could be bound as a single
volume, even though it may not be in practice).

There are a few famous books (in the second sense) in mathematics, for
instance Euclid’s *Elements* and Newton’s *Principia Mathematica*.
Sometimes, as with Euclid, all of what we know about a mathematician is
that he is said to have written a particular book.
