For banking or scientific purposes it is often considered correct to
round something.5 to the nearest even number (**not** always upwards).
For instance, 5.5 rounds to 6, but 12.5 rounds to 12.

This method means that we do not add a bias to a large set of numbers,
by rounding up more often than we round down - but unfortunately at a
lower level we are more often taught to round something.5 upwards all
the time.
