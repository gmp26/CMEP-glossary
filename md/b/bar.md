A unit of pressure, used mainly for talking about atmospheric pressure,
equal to 100000 Pascals.

The ’average’ pressure in the earth’s atmosphere is 1 bar, or 1000
millibars; on the weather forecast you can often see other pressures, in
millibars, which are quite close to this, usually between 950 and 1050
millibars.
