The symbols “(” and “)”, are used to surround an expression that should
be evaluated before being combined with the rest of the expression.

For instance the expression $a(b + c)$ means that you should work out
$b + c$ first, and then multiply it by $a$.

Without the brackets, $ab + c$ would mean $(ab) + c$ since
multiplication takes priority over addition.
