Algebra in which we consider a set S and two commutative operations +
and $\times$, with the rules that:

1.  each of the operations has an identity element in S, and these
    elements are not the same;

2.  each operation is distributive over the other;

3.  each element has an inverse in S under each of the operations.

Note that the operations + and $\times$ are not quite the same as for
the ordinary numbers.

This kind of algebra is widely used in logic and set theory.
