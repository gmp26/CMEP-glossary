A traditional balance is a device for comparing the weights of two
objects; the objects are placed on two pans which are linked into a kind
of see-saw; the heavier object will fall, the lighter will rise. If the
two things have the same weight, they will balance one another.

If you have a set of weights whose sizes you know, a balance can be used
quite easily to find the weight of a new object, by comparing it with
combinations of the known weights. Today, any device for measuring
weight is called a balance, even if it does not involve comparing
weights with one another.
