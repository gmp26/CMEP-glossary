A certain set of paper sizes in common use called the B-series and
designated B4, B5, etc. They are defined as follows:

Each paper size is a rectangle with its sides in the ratio
$ 1 : \sqrt{2}. $ B0 has area $ \sqrt{2} \mathrm{m}^2 , $ B1 half of
this, B2 a quarter, etc. The A- and B- series of paper together form a
series in which each size has $ 1 / \sqrt{2} $ the area of the previous
size.

The B sizes are:

B0 = 1000 $ \times $ 1414mm;

B1= 707 $ \times $ 1000mm;

B2= 500 $ \times $ 707mm;

B3= 353 $ \times $ 500mm;

B4= 250 $ \times $ 353mm;

B5= 176 $ \times $ 250mm;

B6= 125 $ \times $ 176mm;

B7= 88 $ \times $ 125mm;

B8= 62 $ \times $ 88mm;

B9= 44 $ \times $ 62mm;

B10= 31 $ \times $ 44mm.

Paper size B*n* has width $2^{-n/2}$m and height $2^{1/2-n/2}$m. The
sizes are rounded down to ensure that two B4 sheets are slightly smaller
than one B3 sheet, etc.

The height and width of B*n* paper are the geometric means of the
heights and widths of A*n*and A*n+1* papers.
