Charles Babbage (1792-1871) did pioneering work in logic and computing.
His complete mechanical computer, the Difference Engine, and another,
bigger machine (the Analytic Engine) which he never completed, can be
seen in the Science museum in London. They contain features still used
in the design of computers today, and are in theory capable of
performing any mathematical calculation at considerable speed
