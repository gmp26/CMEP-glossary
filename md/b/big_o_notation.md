The notation O(f(x)) means that some quantity is less than a constant
multiple of f(x) for every x, once x is sufficiently large.

For example, $ \mathrm{g(x)} \leq \mathrm{O(x}^2 ) $ means that there is
some constant k with the property that
$ \mathrm{g(x)} \leq \mathrm{kx}^2 $ when x\>n, for some constant n.
