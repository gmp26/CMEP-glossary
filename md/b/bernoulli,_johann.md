Johann Bernoulli (1667-1748): A Swiss mathematician; the father of
Daniel Bernoulli, and brother of Jakob. He studied the (then new)
calculus, and is responsible for the rule known as l’Hôpital’s rule. He
found the equations of the catenary and the brachistochrone, and worked
on the integration of differential equations, the summation of series,
and the calculus of variations.
