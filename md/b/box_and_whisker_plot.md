A way of representing the distribution of a set of data; a solid box is
drawn whose left and right edges correspond to the quartiles, with a
mark inside it to show where the median is. Two ’whiskers’ are attached
to the sides of the box, to show the overall range of the data.

Comparing several box-and-whisker charts can be a useful way of spotting
differences in distributions.
