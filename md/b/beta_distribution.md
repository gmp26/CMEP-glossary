A continuous distribution taking values between 0 and 1, with
distribution function
$$\mathrm{f(x)} = \frac{1}{\mathrm{B(m,n)}} \mathrm{x} ^{\mathrm{m}-1} 
( 1- \mathrm{x} ) ^ {\mathrm{n}-1}$$

where B(m,n) is the beta function and m and n are positive.

U-shaped distributions and the uniform distribution are special cases of
the beta distribution.
