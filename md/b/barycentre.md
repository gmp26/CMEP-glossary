For a body made of of point masses $m_{i} at positions (x_{i},$
$y_{i}, z_{i}),$ the centre of mass is at $ (\bar{\mathrm{x}},
 \bar{\mathrm{y}}, \bar{\mathrm{z}} ) $

where
$ \bar{\mathrm{x}} = \frac{\sum_i \mathrm{x}_i \mathrm{m}_i}{\sum_i \mathrm{m}_i},
\mathrm{  etc.} $

for a continuous body V with density p(x, y, z) at position (x, y, z)
and total mass M,

$ \bar{\mathrm{x}} = \frac{\int_V \mathrm{xpdx}}{\mathrm{M}} $

Roughly speaking, for a flat object the centre of mass is the place
where the object will balance; for a solid it is the point that will
always hang vertically below the point of suspension, when the object is
suspended from any point.
