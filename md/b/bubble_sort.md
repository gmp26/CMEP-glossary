A sorting algorithm:

First pass:

- compare item 1 with item 2; swap them if necessary;

- compare item 2 with item 3; swap them if necessary;

- etc. - this ensures that the last item is the largest;

second pass:

-as the first pass, but stop at the second from last item - this ensures
that the final two items are the two largest;

third pass... etc.
