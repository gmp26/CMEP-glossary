A discrete distribution, written B(n, p) and given by:
$$P(r) =  {n \choose r} p^r (1-p)^{n-r}$$ where $ {n \choose r} $ is a
binomial coefficient.

It is the distribution of the number of successes out of n independent
Bernoulli trials, each with probability p of success.

It has mean np and variance npq.

It has PGF $G(t)=(q+pt)^n.$

As n becomes very large, the distribution becomes narrower, forming a
peak around X=pn (i.e. on average, a proportion p of the trials will be
successful).
