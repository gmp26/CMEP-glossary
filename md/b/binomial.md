An expression containing two terms, joined by + or - , is described as
binomial, or is simply called a binomial.

The binomial theorem tells us what happens when a binomial expression is
raised to a power; the expansion and the series it leads to are called
the binomial expansion and binomial series. A binomial distribution is
described by a formula related to the binomial expansion.

A binomial equation is a particular kind of equation, which contains two
