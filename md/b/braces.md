The symbols <span> and </span> which are sometimes used in equations to
mean the same thing as parentheses; what is inside the braces is to be
worked out first, and then combined with everything else.

Sometimes we use braces as well as parentheses, when it would be
confusing to have a lot of parentheses; eg:

$\{(x^{2} + y^{2})(z + x) - (z^{2} + y)^{2}\}^{2}$

Braces are also used to define sets. For example, the set of even
numbers can be defined by:
$$E = \{x \in \mathbb{Z}|x = 0 \mathrm{mod} 2\}$$
