We write $ {p \choose q} $ to mean $ \frac{p!}{q! (p-q)!} $ . It is the
same as $^{p}C_{q},$ or ${p \choose q}$. A number like this is called a
binomial coefficient, because they occur in the binomial expansion, eg:
$$(x + y)^4 =  {4 \choose 0}  x^4 +  
{4 \choose 1}  x^3 y+  {4 \choose 2} 
 x^2 y^2 +  {4 \choose 3} 
xy^3 +  {4 \choose 4}  y^4$$ $$= x^4 + 4 x^3 y + 6 x^2 y^2 +
 4 xy^3 + y^4.$$

Also, the binomial coefficient $ {p \choose q} $ is equal to the number
in the $p^{th}$ row, $q$ places from the left, in Pascalâ€™s triangle
(starting to count at zero).
