Take the sequence 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, ...

Add 4 to each number.

Divide by 10.

The resulting sequence, 0.4, 0.7, 1.0, 1.6, 2.8, 5.2, 10.0, 19.6, 38.8
etc, is very close to the sequence of mean distances of the planets from
the sun, expressed as multiples of the earthâ€™s distance from the sun:

0.39, 0.72, 1.00, 1.52, 5.20, 9.54, 19.19

The missing number in the sequence (2.8) is very close to the distance
of the asteroid belt from the sun.

Current theories about planet formation suggest that roughly geometric
series of distances is to be expected; this particular pattern is
thought to exist by chance.
