Using the axiom of choice and the idea of non-measurable sets, we can
show that for the balls of radius 1 and 2, B(1) and B(2), there exist
sets such that: $ \mathrm{B(1)=C}_1 \cup \mathrm{C}_2 \cup ... \cup 
\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{n}} $

and $ \mathrm{B(2)=D}_1 \cup \mathrm{D}_2 \cup ... \cup 
\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{n}} $

and $C_{k} is isometric to D_{k}$ for each value of k.

The sets are fractals; their volumes cannot be computed in the way that
an ’ordinary’ set’s could be.
