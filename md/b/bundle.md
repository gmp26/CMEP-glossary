A map between two topological spaces A and B, where the sets $f^{-1}(b)$
for elements b of B (called ’fibres’), are all homeomorphic to a single
space.

The simplest example is the Möbius strip, for which A is the Möbius
strip, B is a circle, and the fibres are homeomorphic to an interval on
the real number line.
