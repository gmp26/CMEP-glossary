In elementary maths, a vector is a quantity which has both size and
direction. For instance the wind might be measured by a vector, since it
has both speed and direction.

Sometimes it is helpful to think of a vector as a directed line segment.

At a higher level we define a vector as a member of a set of objects
which obeys the rules of vector algebra - i.e. a member of a vector
space.
