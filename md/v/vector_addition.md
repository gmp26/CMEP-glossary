To add two vectors together, take the lines which represent them, and
place them end-to-end.

Or, add them component by component: $$\left ( 
\begin{array}{cc} 
  1 \ 2 
\end{array} 
\right ) + 
\left ( 
\begin{array}{c}  
  4 \\ 
  3 
\end{array} 
\right ) 
= \left ( 
\begin{array}{cc} 
  1 + 4 \\
  2 + 3 
\end{array} 
\right )$$ $$= \left ( 
\begin{array}{c} 
  5 \\
  5 
\end{array} 
\right )$$
