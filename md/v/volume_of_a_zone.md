If a spherical zone is formed by the intersection of a sphere with
centre O and radius r, and two planes at z=a and z=b, then the volume of
the zone is $ \frac{\pi}{3} ( {b} ( 3 {R} ^2 - {b}^2 ) 
- {b} ( 3 {R} ^2 - {a} ^2 ) ) . $

(NB that this is only true if |a|,|b|\<R.

In the case of a zone of one base we have a=R so $ {V} =
\frac{\pi}{3} ( {a} ^3 - 3 {R} ^2 {a} + 2 {R} ^2 ) . $
