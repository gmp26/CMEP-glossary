Take a circle with a diameter PQ, and draw a tangent to the circle at Q.
Pick a point R on the circle, and extend the line PR to intersect the
tangent. Call this intersection S. Draw a line parallel to PQ through S,
and one parallel to the tangent through R. The intersection of these
last two lines is called P’. The locus of P’ as R moves around the
circle, is called a versiera or witch of Agnesi.

The curve has an equation of the form: $xy^{2} = 4a^{2}(2a-x),$ where a
is the radius of the circle.
