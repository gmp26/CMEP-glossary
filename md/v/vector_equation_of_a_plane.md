A plane containing the point ǎ and having direction vectors b and č has
equation ${\mathbf{x}}={\mathbf{a}}+t{\mathbf{b}}+u{\mathbf{c}}$, where
$t$ and $u$ may be any real numbers.

Note that b and č must not be parallel to one another.

Alternatively: given a point $A$ with position vector ǎ and a normal
vector ň, the plane perpendicular to ň through ǎ has vector equation
$({\mathbf{r}}-{\mathbf{a}}).{\mathbf{n}} = 0$.
