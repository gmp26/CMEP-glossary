Laplace famously talked about a huge computing machine, that could be
told the current position and speed of every particle in the universe,
and would be able to work out the future motion of everything from this
information. He called this machine the Vast Intellect. This attitude
exemplifies a deterministic view of the world, which has been superseded
by the realisation that random and chaotic processes are also important.
