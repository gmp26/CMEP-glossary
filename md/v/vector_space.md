A set of vectors V, associated with a field of scalars F, with the
following properties:

​1) There is an operation of vector addition, which is associative and
commutative and has an identity element 0 which is in V, and if a and b
are in V, then a+b is in V; also the additive inverse of any vector in V
is in V;

​2) There is an associative operation which multiplies a vector by a
scalar; multiplication is distributive over both vector addition and
scalar addition; if v is in V and f is in F then f\*v is in V;
multiplication by the unit element of F leaves elements of V unchanged.
