The following set of rules are called the rules of vector algebra:

addition:
:   if ${\mathbf{x}}=(x_{1}, x_{2}, ... , x_{n})$ and
    ${\mathbf{y}}=(y_{1}, y_{2}, ... , y_{n}),$ then
    ${\mathbf{x}}+{\mathbf{y}}=(x_{1}+y_{1}, x_{2}+y_{2},\dots , x_{n}+y_{n});$

scalar multiplication:
:   if ${\mathbf{x}}=(x_{1}, x_{2}, ... , x_{n})$ is a vector and $t$ is
    a scalar, then $t{\mathbf{x}}=(tx_{1}, tx_{2},$ ..., $tx_{n}).$

A closed set of objects obeying these rules is a vector space. A single
such object is a vector.
