A measure of spread of a distribution. It is equal to the mean of the
squared distance of the variable from its mean: $$\mathrm{Var(x)} = 
\frac{1}{\mathrm{n}} \sum _{\mathrm{x}} ( \mathrm{x} - \bar{\mathrm{x}} ) ^2 ,$$
where n is the number of possible values of x, and $ \bar{\mathrm{x}} $
means the mean of x.

It is often written $ \sigma ^2 , $ where $ \sigma $ is the standard
deviation.

It can be shown that the variance of X is equal to
$ \bar{(\mathrm{x}^2)} - ( \bar{\mathrm{x}})^2 , $ where
$ \bar{(\mathrm{x}^2)} $ means the mean of $x^{2}.$
