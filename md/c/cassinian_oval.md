Given two points A and B and a constant $c^{2},$ the locus of points P
with $PA.PB=c^{2}$ is called Cassiniâ€™s ovals.

The locus has equation
$(x^{2}+y^{2})^{2}-2a^{2}(x^{2}-y^{2})^{2}-a^{4}+c^{4}=0,$ where a=AB.

This is the same set of curves as the cross-sections of a circular torus
taken parallel to its axis.

If c=a, then the curve is a lemniscate.
