Given a graph which cuts the plane into a number of separate regions, we
can fill each region with a particular colour; if we insist that no two
adjacent regions have the same colour, we can ask questions about how
many colours are needed to colour in a particular graph, or to colour in
any graph on a particular kind of surface (eg colouring problems on the
surface of a sphere might need more colours than ones in a plane).
