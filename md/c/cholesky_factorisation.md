If A is a symmetric positive definite matrix, we can write $A=R^{T}R$
where R is an upper triangular matrix with positive entries on the
leading diagonal. This is called a Cholesky factorisation of A.

For example, $$\left( 
\begin{array}{cc} 
  1 & -2 \\ -2 & 13 
\end{array} 
\right)
= \left( 
\begin{array}{cc}
  1 & 0 \\
  -2 & 3 
\end{array} 
\right) 
\left( 
\begin{array}{cc}
  1 & -2 \\
  0 & 3 
\end{array} 
\right).$$
