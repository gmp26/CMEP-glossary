A congruence is a mathematical statement which says that two numbers are
congruent to one another, in other words they both give the same
remainder when they are divided by another number.

eg the congruence $ 9 \equiv 5 (\mathrm{mod} 4) $ means that when we
divide them by 4, 9 and 5 both give the same remainder (1).
