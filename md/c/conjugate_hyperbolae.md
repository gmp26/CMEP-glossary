Two hyperbolae are said to be conjugate if they have the following
properties:

They have the same asymptotes;

The transverse axis of one is the conjugate axis of the other, and
vice-versa.

This means that they can be written in the form: $ \left \{ 
\begin{array}{c} 
  \frac{x^2}{a^2}- \frac{y^2}{b^2}=1 \\
  \frac{x^2}{a^2}- \frac{y^2}{b^2}=-1
\end{array} 
\right \}$
