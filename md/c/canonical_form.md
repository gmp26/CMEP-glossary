If we specify a class of matrices, and a type of transformation, then
often we can define a form to which all such matrices can be converted
by those transformations. Such a form is called a canonical form. for
instance, any symmetric matrix can be turned into a diagonal matrix
using similarity transformations, so ’diagonal’ is a canonical form for
symmetric matrices.
