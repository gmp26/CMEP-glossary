Major Andre-Louis Cholesky (1875-1918) The mathematician after whom the
Cholesky factorisation is named. He was born in France, and worked in
the Geodesic section of the Geographic service to the French armyâ€™s
artillery branch. At this time the system of triangulation used in
France, and based on the meridian line of Paris, was being revised; new
methods were needed in order to facilitate what was not yet a quick or
convenient process.

Cholesky invented computation procedures based on the method of least
squares, for the solution of certain data-fitting problems in geodesy,
to be put into practice in his triangulation of the French and British
parts of Crete, and in his work in Algeria and Tunisia.

His mathematical work was posthumously published on his behalf in 1924
by a fellow officer, Benoit.
