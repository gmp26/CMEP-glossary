An Italian mathematician who did some of the first work on probability.
He is best known for his book on algebra, *Ars magna*, in which he
revealed the general formulae for solving cubic equations (discovered by
Tartaglia but often known as Cardanoâ€™s method) and quartic equations
(discovered by Ferrari).
