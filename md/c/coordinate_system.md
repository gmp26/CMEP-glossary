A systematic way of describing points in space using sets of three
numbers (or points in a plane using pairs of numbers). Usually a
coordinate system will use at least one straight line called an axis,
and will measure distances along this axis to find one of the
coordinates. Other coordinates may be defined in a similar way, with
other axes at right angles to the first, or they may be defined as
angles, etc.
