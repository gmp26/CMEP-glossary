If we have a fixed point A and two given curves C and D, then the
cissoid of the two curves with respect to A is constructed as follows:
pick a point on C, say P, and draw a line, l, through P and A. This cuts
D at Q. Let R be the point on l such that AP=QR. The locus of R as P
moves on C, is the cissoid.
