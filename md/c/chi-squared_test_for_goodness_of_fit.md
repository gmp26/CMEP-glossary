A test of the null hypothesis that a population has a given distribution
$f_{e}.$ The test statistic is $ \sum \frac{(f_o - f_e ) ^2 } {f_e} , $
where $f_{o}$ is the observed distribution. We test by grouping the data
into k cells each of which would have expected frequency at least 5; we
estimate any necessary parameters from the data, the number of such
parameters is p. The distribution used is $ \chi ^2 $ with k-p-1 degrees
of freedom.
