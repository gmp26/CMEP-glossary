For a given inhomogeneous differential equation, a complementary
function is a solution to the corresponding homogeneous differential
equation.

For example, for:
$$\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 \mathrm{y}}{\mathrm{dx}^2} + \mathrm{y} 
= \mathrm{x}^2+\mathrm{xy}$$ a complementary function is a solution to:
$$\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 \mathrm{y}}{\mathrm{dx}^2} + \mathrm{y} = 0$$
