Generally, any way of representing something using numbers, letters and
symbols. For instance:

- codes are used for security; we turn words and sentences into strings
of numbers, letters and symbols, which are hard to decode.

- codes are used in computer programming; instructions which humans can
read are turned into code (numbers, letters and symbols) which a
computer can read.

- a bar code represents information, often the name and price of a
product, using a series of vertical lines.
