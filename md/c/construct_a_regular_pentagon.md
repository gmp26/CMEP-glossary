A regular pentagon can be constructed as follows: Draw a circle. Draw
one of its diameters AB, and draw another diameter perpendicular to
this, CD. Let O be the centre of the circle, and X the midpoint of OC.
Then find Y on OD such that XY=XA. Now draw an arc of radius AY and
centre A. This arc cuts the circle at E and F; now E, F and A are three
of the vertices of a regular pentagon, and the other two vertices may be
found easily (eg an arc of radius AY with centre E will cut the circle
at another vertex).
