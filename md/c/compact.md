A topological space is compact if every open cover of the entire space
has a finite subcover. For example, $ [a,b] $ is compact in
$ \mathbb{R} $ (the Heine-Borel theorem). The continuous image of a
compact set is compact, as is a closed subset of a compact set.
Moreover, there is a partial converse in that every compact set of a
Hausdorff space is closed. The compact subsets of $ \mathbb{R}^n $ are
precisely the closed and bounded subsets. For subsets
$ X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n $ , $ X $ is compact iff it is sequentially
compact iff it is closed and bounded. See also totally bounded.
