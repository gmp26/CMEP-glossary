An object which can be broken down into smaller indivisible objects, or
which has been made by combining two or more smaller objects, is called
composite.

For example, a composite number can be factorised into prime numbers; a
composite vector is the result of adding two or more vectors together. A
composite function is made by applying two or more functions
consecutively.
