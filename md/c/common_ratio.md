If four quantities a, b, c, d satisfy a:b=c:d, then we say that they
have a common ratio. This is the case, for instance, if a and b are two
lengths in a shape, and c and d are the corresponding lengths in an
enlargement of the shape.

In a geometric series a, ar, $ar^{2}, ar^{3},$ ..., r is the common
ratio, as the ratio of each term to the previous one is r.
