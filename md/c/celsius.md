A temperature scale. The key points of this scale are $0^{\circ}$, the
temperature at which ice melts, and $100^{\circ}$, the temperature at
which water boils.

It is named after the Swedish scientist who devised the scale.

You can get temperatures that go below zero degrees as well as above a
hundred degrees.

- another name for Celsius is Centigrade.
