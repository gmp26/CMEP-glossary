The cartesian co-ordinate system describes any point on a plane using
two numbers, and any point in space using three numbers, by using a set
of two or three axes at right angles to one another and measuring along
these axes. It is named after Descartes, who invented it while thinking
about how to describe the positions of flies on his ceiling when he was
ill.
