The sequence of numbers given by $$u_n = \frac{{2n \choose n}}{n+1}$$ or
$$u_n = \frac{(2n )! }{( n+1 )! n!}.$$ The sequence begins 1, 2, 5, 14,
42, 132, 429, 1430, 4862, 16796, 58786, 208012, 742900, 2674440, 9694845

The numbers represent the number of ways a polygon with n+2 sides can be
cut into n triangles using straight lines joining vertices. They arise
in other counting problems, too.
