A theory which attempts to explain the behaviour of complex dynamical
systems by relating it to topology. If the state of a given system can
be represented by a set of points in n-dimensional space, then this set
can be classified topologically. The evolution of the system will
consist of slow continuous motion interspersed with sudden,
’catastrophic’ jumps, when the topology of the set changes.

The theory an be applied to economics, engineering, etc.
