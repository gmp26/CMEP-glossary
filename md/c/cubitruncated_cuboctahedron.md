The 21st uniform polyhedron is the Cubitruncated cuboctahedron; it has
Wythoff symbol 4/3 3 4|. Its dual is the tetradyakishexahedron. The
pattern of polygons round each vertex is (8/3,6,8); its symmetry group
is the octahedral group S4.

It has:

Euler characteristic: -4

Density: 4

Number of vertices: 48

Number of edges: 72

Number of faces: 20 (=6 octagons and 8 hexagons and 6<span>8/3</span>).

Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining
every $b^{th}$ of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made
by taking five points and joining every second point.
