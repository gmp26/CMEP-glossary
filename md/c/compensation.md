In order to perform a calculation on two numbers, we sometimes round one
of the numbers to make the calculation simpler. Then we perform an
addition or subtraction, to compensate.

Eg $99 \times 5:$ we do $100 \times 5=500,$ and then we subtract 5 (ie
$(100-99) \times 5)$ to obtain the answer: 495.
