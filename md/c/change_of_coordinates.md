Sometimes we want to start using a different set of coordinates to
represent things, instead of the set we have already been using. This is
called a change of coordinates.

If both sets of coordinates are Cartesian, then we can change a vector
in the old coordinates to one in the new coordinates by multiplying it
by a matrix M. M is found by writing down what the old x-, y-, and z-
unit vectors are in the new coordinates; they will be the columns of M.
