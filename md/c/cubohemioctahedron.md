The 20th uniform polyhedron is the Cubohemioctahedron; it has Wythoff
symbol 4/3 4|3. Its dual is the hexahemioctacron. The pattern of
polygons round each vertex is (6,4/3,6,4); its symmetry group is the
octahedral group S4.

It has:

Euler characteristic: -2

It is one-sided; it has

Number of vertices: 12

Number of edges: 24

Number of faces: 10 (=4 hexagons and 3 quadrilaterals and
3<span>4/3</span>).

Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining
every $b^{th}$ of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made
by taking five points and joining every second point.
