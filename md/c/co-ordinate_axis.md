A straight line with passes through the origin, which is used to measure
the position of points. For instance an x-axis is used to find the
x-coordinate of a point as follows: draw a line from the point to the
axis, perpendicular to the axis. Then measure how far from the origin
the line crosses the axis. This distance is the x-coordinate of the
point.
