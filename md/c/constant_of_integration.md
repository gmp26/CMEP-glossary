When we carry out an indefinite integration with respect to x, we are
doing something that is the same as working backwards from information
about the slope of a curve to the curve itself. But this information is
not enough to tell us how far away the curve is from the x-axis; it can
only tell us how much it goes up and down with respect to the axis.

So the absolute position of the curve is unknown; the answer to our
integration must include a constant whose value we do not know. This is
called the constant of integration.

Example: $3x^{2}+3 could be the derivative of x^{3}+3x,$ or , or
$x^{3}+3x+100, etc. So we write the integral as x^{3}+3x+C.$ C is the
constant of integration.
