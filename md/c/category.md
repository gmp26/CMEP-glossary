A set C of functions, which is closed under compositions and contains
the identity functions of all the source and target sets of functions in
f.

i.e. if f and g are in C, then fg and gf are in C;

and if f is in C and f maps set A onto set B, then the identity
functions on A and B are both in C.

Most mathematicians simply define a category as a set of objects
together with a set of ’morphisms’ which are functions from one object
onto another. Composition of morphisms must be associative, and each
object has an identity morphism. An example is the category of real
vector spaces, where the objects are vector space and the morphisms are
linear transformations.
