Arthur Cayley (1821-1895): English mathematician. He published
prolifically on every branch of mathematics; some of his most important
work was on matrices, non-euclidean geometry and higher-dimensional
geometry, permutations and abstract groups.

The Cayley-Hamilton theorem, and Cayleyâ€™s sextic, bear his name.
