To construct the inscribed circle of a given triangle:

Construct the angle bisectors of two of the angles of the triangle;

Find the intersection, A, of the two angle bisectors;

Mark the intersection of this line with the triangle’s side, B;

Use compasses to draw a circle with centre A that passes through B.
