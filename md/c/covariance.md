A statistic which measures the agreement between two sets of data. For
variables X and Y, with means x and y, the covariance is
Cov(X,Y)=E(XY)-xy.

The covariance of two samples of equal size $x_{i}, y_{i}$ is:
$ \mathrm{c}_{\mathrm{xy}} = \sum _{\mathrm{i}} \frac{1}{\mathrm{n}}
( \mathrm{x}_{\mathrm{i}} - \bar{\mathrm{x}} )( \mathrm{y}_{\mathrm{i}} -
\bar{\mathrm{y}} ) . $

Covariance depends on the scale used to make the measurements, unlike
correlation, which is another measure of the agreement between sets of
data.
