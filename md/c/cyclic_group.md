A group which is generated by a single element is called cyclic. For
instance, the group of rotations through multiples of $90^{\circ}$ can
be generated from the single element which is a single clockwise
rotation of $90^{\circ}$. The other rotations are produced by repeating
this rotation.

The single element is called a generator for the group.

A cyclic group of order n is isomorphic to the group of integers modulo
n under addition.
