The solid of revolution formed by rotating y=f(x) between x=a and x=b
through $360^{\circ}$ about the x-axis has centre of mass at
$ ( \bar{x} , 0 ) , $ where
$ \bar{x} = \int _a ^b \pi xy^2 dx / \int _a ^b \pi y^2 dx . $

The solid of revolution formed by rotating x=g(y) between y=p and y=q
through $360^{\circ}$ about the y-axis has centre of mass at
$ ( 0, \bar{y} ) , $ where
$ \bar{y} = \int _p ^q \pi x^2 y dy / \int _p ^q \pi x^2 dy . $
