Given two lines which intersect at A, construct their angle bisector as
follows:

use compasses to draw a circle centred on A (the radius does not
matter);

mark the places where this circle intersects the two lines, B and C;

use compasses to draw two circles, both of the same radius, centred on B
and C;

mark one of the places where these two circles intersect, D;

draw a line through A and D - this is the angle bisector.
