The 12nd uniform polyhedron is the Cuboctahedron; it has Wythoff symbol
2|3 4. Its dual is the rhombic dodecahedron. It can be formed by
truncating a cube, or by truncating an octahedron.

The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (3,4,3,4); its symmetry
group is the octahedral group S4.

It has:

Euler characteristic: 2

Density: 1

Number of vertices: 12

Number of edges: 24

Number of faces: 14 (=6 quadrilaterals and 8 triangles).
