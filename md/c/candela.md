A unit of luminous intensity, symbol cd.

The luminance or photometric brightness of a black body at the
temperature of freezing platinum equals 60 candela per square
centimetre.

So, the candela is the luminous intensity (in the perpendicular
direction) of a surface of 1/600 000 $m^{2}$ of a black body at the
temperature of freezing platinum under a pressure of 101 325 $Nm^{-2}.$
