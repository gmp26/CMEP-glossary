To construct is to make a particular geometric object by actually
drawing it; often using only pencil, compasses and straightedge. A
construction is a way to construct a particular object.

Sometimes we talk about proof by construction in other areas of maths,
where we show that something is possible by actually making or
calculating an example of it.
