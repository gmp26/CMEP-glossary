A polyhedron formed from several simpler polyhedra. For example: take a
regular dodecahedron; there are five different ways of choosing eight of
its vertices so as to make a cube. If we construct all of these cubes at
once we have the compound polyhedron of five cubes in a dodecahedron.

There are various other ways to construct compound polyhedra.
