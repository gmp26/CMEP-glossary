A conchoid in which the given line is a straight line; i.e. given a line
C and a point A we pick a point Q on C, draw a line l through A and Q,
and mark P and P’ on l at some fixed distance from Q. The conchoid of
Nicomedes is the locus of P and P’ as Q moves along C.

It has polar equation $ \mathrm{R=a.sec} \theta + \mathrm{k}. $
