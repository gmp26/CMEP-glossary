The branch of calculus which deals with trying to find the maxima or
minima of definite integrals. An example is the problem of finding the
shape of the curve down which a particle will slide in the shortest
length of time; this leads us to try to minimise
$ \int _0 ^1 \sqrt { \frac{1+( \mathrm{f} ^{\prime} \mathrm{(x)})^2}{2 \mathrm{g.f(x)}}} $
where g is a constant. This can be done by finding a differential
equation that f(x) must satisfy.
