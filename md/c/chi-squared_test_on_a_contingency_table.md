For a contingency table with r rows and c columns, and expected
frequency of each cell at least 5, this is a test for the null
hypothesis that the row and column classifications are independent. The
distribution used is $ \chi ^2 $ with (r-1)(c-1) degrees of freedom; the
test statistic is $ \sum \frac{(f_o - f_e ) ^2 } {f_e} , $ where $f_{e}$
is the expected distribution and $f_{o}$ the observed function.
