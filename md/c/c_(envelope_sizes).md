A certain set of envelope sizes in common use are called the C-series
and designated C4, C3, etc. They are defined as follows:

Each envelope size is a rectangle with its sides in the ratio
$ 1 : \sqrt{2} . $ C0 has area $ \sqrt[4]{2} \mathrm{m}^2 ,$ C1 half of
this, C2 a quarter, etc.

So the sizes are:

C0 = 917 $ \times $ 1297 mm;

C1 = 648 $ \times $ 917 mm;

C2 = 458 $ \times $ 648 mm;

C3 = 324 $ \times $ 458 mm;

C4 = 229 $ \times $ 324 mm;

C5 = 162 $ \times $ 229 mm;

C6 = 114 $ \times $ 162 mm;

C7 = 81 $ \times $ 114 mm;

C8 = 57 $ \times $ 81 mm;

C9 = 40 $ \times $ 57 mm;

C10 = 28 $ \times $ 40 mm.

Size C*n* has width $2^{-1/8-n/2}$ m and height $2^{3/8-n/2}$ m.

The sizes are rounded down to ensure that two C4 envelopes are slightly
smaller than one A3 sheet, etc.

The height and width of size C*n* are the geometric means of the heights
and widths of paper sizes A*n* and B*n*, so that A4 fits comfortably
into C4, etc.
