This is a test of the null hypothesis that the population variance is
$ \sigma ^2 . $ We have a sample of size n and we compute an unbiased
estimate of the population variance $s^{2}$ using divisor n-1. The
distribution used is $ \chi ^2 $ with n-1 degrees of freedom; the test
statistic is $ \frac{(n-1)s^2}{\sigma ^2 } . $

We assume that the population is normal.
