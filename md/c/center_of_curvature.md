The centre of curvature of a curve at any point is the centre of the
osculating circle at that point.

The centre of curvature of a curve at a point **r** is given by
$ c = r + \rho \hat{n} , $ where $ \rho $ is the radius of curvature at
that point, and $ \hat{n}  $ is the unit normal vector to the curve at
that point.
