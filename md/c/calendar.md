A set of tables showing the days and months of a year. Today we use the
Gregorian calendar, which was introduced in 1582 by Pope Gregory XII.

Before that the Julian calendar was used. This had been established by
Julius Caesar in 46 BC.

Calendars are based on the how long it takes the earth to go round the
Sun.
