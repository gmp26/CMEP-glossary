A property of some sequences. A sequence is called convergent if it
converges, i.e. a sequence $u_{i}$ is convergent if there exists a value
u with the property that by choosing a large enough value of i, we can
make $u_{i}$ as close as we wish to u.

Formally, $u_{i}$ is convergent if:
$$\exists u : \forall \epsilon > 0 , \exists n \in \mathbb{N}
\quad\mbox{such that}\quad \forall i \geq n ,  | u_i - u | \leq \epsilon 
.$$
