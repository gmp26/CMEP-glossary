If a figure has a hollow, going in like a cave, it is concave.

You can test for concavity by picking two points inside the figure and
joining them together with a line; if for some pairs of points the line
goes outside the figure, it is concave.

A polygon is concave if it has an interior angle which is greater than
180 degrees.
