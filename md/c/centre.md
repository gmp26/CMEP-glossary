The middle of something. In particular:

The centre of a line is the point halfway along it.

The centre of a circle is the point at an equal distance from every
point on the edge.

A triangle has several centres, defined in different ways, eg the
orthocentre, incentre, centroid, circumcentre.

When we talk about the centre of a shape or solid we often mean its
centre of gravity.
