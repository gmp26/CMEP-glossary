This is a word that is used in different contexts in mathematics to mean
different things:

Conjugate angles add up to $360^{\circ}$;

The complex conjugate of a complex number $z = x+iy$ is $z^* = x-iy$;

Conjugate lines of a conic have the property that each contains the pole
point of the other;

Conjugate points of a conic have the property that each lies on the
polar line of the other;

etc.

In general, conjugate indicates that there is a symmetrical relationship
between two objects A and B; there is an operation which will turn A
into B and B into A.
