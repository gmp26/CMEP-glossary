To construct a line perpendicular to a given line L, through a given
point P:

Use compasses to draw a circle centred on P, large enough to intersect L
twice;

Mark the points where this circle intersects L, A and B;

Use compasses again to draw two circles of the same radius, centred on A
and B;

Mark the point where these two circles intersect, C;

Draw a line through P and C - this is the required perpendicular.
