A cofactor of a particular number in a matrix is the determinant of the
matrix formed by removing that numberâ€™s row, and its column.

For instance: in $ 
\left( 
\begin{array}{ccc}
  1 & 2 & 3 \\
  4 & 5 & 6 \\
  7 & 8 & 9 
\end{array} 
\right), 
$ the cofactor of 2 is $ 
\left| 
\begin{array}{cc}
  4 & 6 \\
  7 & 9 
\end{array} 
\right| 
= 4 \times 9 - 6 \times 7 
= -6$
