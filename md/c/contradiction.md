In the context of mathematical proof, a contradiction occurs when you reach a statement that is incompatible with the assumptions of the proof, or is axiomatically false.

E.g. Assume that there is a smallest positive rational number, call it $r$. But then $\frac{r}{2}$ is also a positive rational number, and is smaller than $r$. This contradicts our original assumption, so in fact there is no such number.
