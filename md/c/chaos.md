A system, usually in dynamics, is chaotic if:

- it is predictable in principle;

- what happens to it in the long run depends very sensitively on how it
is set up in the first place, which makes it very hard to predict in
practice

- there is usually some way of describing the general types of long-term
behaviour, like a ’strange attractor’.

For instance, the weather, or the movements of three stars around one
another, are chaotic systems.
