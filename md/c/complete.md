Of a metric space: having the property that every Cauchy sequence is
convergent.

Of a normed vector space: having the property that the corresponding
metric space (with the natural metric) is complete in the sense above.
Such a space is called a Banach space.

A logical system is complete if everything that can be stated within the
system can be either proved or disproved within the system.
