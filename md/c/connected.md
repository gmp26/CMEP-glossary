A topological space $ (X, \tau ) $ is connected if we cannot find open
disjoint non-empty subsets $ U,V \subseteq  X $ such that $ X=U \cup V $
. Such sets $ U,V $ would be said to disconnect $ X $ . Equivalent
conditions to connectedness are that every continuous function
$ X \mapsto \mathbb{Z} $ is constant, and that the only subsets that are
both open and closed are $  \emptyset $ and $ X $ itself. The connected
subsets of $  \mathbb{R} $ are precisely the intervals. Compare
Hausdorff space, path connected, polygonally connected.
