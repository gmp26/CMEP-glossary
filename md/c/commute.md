Two elements of a set (or of a field or a group, etc) are said to
commute with respect to a certain operation (usually multiplication or
composition) if the order in which they are taken does not matter for
the purpose of combining them using that operation.

For instance, a and b are said to commute under operation \* if
a\*b=b\*a.
