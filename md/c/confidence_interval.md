The confidence interval is a statistic constructed from a sample to
provide an interval estimate for a parameter. It provides a range of
values around the point estimate that at a given probability (confidence
level) will cover (contain) the true value and in this way shows how
precise the estimate is.

When estimating some unknown parameter (like mean), the point estimate
(like sample mean) is usually not exactly correct. A confidence interval
is a better way of presenting the results.

The confidence level associated with the interval, usually 90 is the
percentage of times in repeated sampling that the intervals will cover
the true value of the unknown parameter.
