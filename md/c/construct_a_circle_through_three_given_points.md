If we are given three points A, B and C, and we are to draw a circle
through all three of them, we can do this as follows:

Construct the perpendicular bisectors of AB and BC, and find the point O
where they intersect. Using compasses, draw a circle with centre O which
passes through A; this circle will also pass through B and C.
