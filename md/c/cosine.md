In a right-angled triangle, if one of the angles is $\theta$, then the
cosine of $\theta$ is the length of the side adjacent to $\theta$,
divided by the length of the hypotenuse.
$$\cos \theta = \frac{\mbox{adjacent}}{\mbox{hypoteneuse}}$$
Alternatively, and more generally, $\cos \theta$ is the $x$ coordinate
of a point $P$ obtained by rotating $(1,0)$ about the origin through an
angle $\theta$.
