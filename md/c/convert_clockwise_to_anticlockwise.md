1/4 turn clockwise is the same as 3/4 turn anticlockwise;

1/2 turn clockwise is the same as 1/2 turn anticlockwise.

In general, a fraction f of a turn clockwise is the same as a fraction
(1-f) of a turn anticlockwise.

In degrees, this is expressed by subtracting the size of the turn from
360$^\circ$. For instance, 180$^\circ$ clockwise = 180$^\circ$
anticlockwise, 181$^\circ$ clockwise = 179$^\circ$ anticlockwise, etc.
