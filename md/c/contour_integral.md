If we have a function f defined in the complex plane, and a curve C in
the complex plane, then the integral of f along C is called a contour
integral and is written $ \int _{\mathrm{C}}
\mathrm{f(z)dz} . $

Such an integral can be defined as follows: dissect C into n segments
with endpoints $x_{0}...x_{n}. Pick a point z_{i}$ in each segment. The
integral is the limit, if it exists, of the sum
$ \sum \mathrm{f(z} _{\mathrm{i}} ) ( \mathrm{x}_{\mathrm{i}} - \mathrm{x}_{\mathrm{i-1}}
) , $ as n approaches infinity and the length of the longest segment
goes to zero.
