Given a triangle ABC, we can construct the outscribed circle as follows:

Draw the perpendicular bisector of AB;

Draw the perpendicular bisector of BC;

Label the point of intersection of these two bisectors, D;

Use compasses to draw a circle with centre D, which passes through A. It
will also pass through B and C, so it is the outscribed circle of
triangle ABC.
