A special case of a cissoid; given a circle, a diameter AB of the
circle, and the tangent to the circle at A, a cissoid of Diocles is the
cissoid of the circle and the tangent with respect to B.

It has polar equation $ r = 2a ( \sec \theta - \cos \theta ) . $

This curve is the inverse of a parabola with respect to its vertex.
