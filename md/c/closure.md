The closure of $ A $ , written $  \bar{A} $ is the intersection of all
closed sets containing $ A $ ; a point $ b \in \bar{A} $ iff every
neighbourhood of $ b $ contains points of $ A $ . The closure of a set
is closed. We say that a set $ X_0 $ is dense in $ X $ if
$  \bar{X_0}=X $ . This means that any point in $ X $ can be
approximated arbitrarily closely by elements of $ X_0 $ .
