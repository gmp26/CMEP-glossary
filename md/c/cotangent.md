In a right-angled triangle, if one of the angles is $\theta$, then the
cotangent of $\theta$ is the length of the side next to $\theta$ divided
by the length of the side opposite $\theta$.
$$\cot \theta = \frac{\mbox{adjacent}}{\mbox{opposite}}$$ More
generally, $cot \theta = \frac{x}{y}$, where $(x,y)$ is the point
obtained by rotating $(1,0)$ about $(0,0)$ through the angle $\theta$.
$$\cot \theta =  \frac{1}{\tan \theta} = \frac{cos \theta}{sin \theta}.$$
