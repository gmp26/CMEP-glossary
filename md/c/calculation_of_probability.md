To calculate the probability of a particular event, we may have to use
statistical theorems, like Bayesâ€™ Theorem, or perform experiments and
collect statistics to see how likely the event is to happen. Often, we
can only calculate probabilities approximately, if the situation
involved is complicated or not very well controlled.
