Augustin Louis Cauchy (1789-1857): French mathematician.

He worked on geometry - polygons and polyhedra - symmetric functions,
definite integrals, complex functions, differential equations, and other
topics. He investigated the conditions for convergence of infinite
series, and gave a rigorous definition of the integral operator.

Many pieces of mathematics are named after him; the Cauchy-Schwarz
inequality, the Cauchy-Riemann equations, Cauchy sequences and the
Cauchy integral theorem, for instance.
