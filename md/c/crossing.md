Knots are classified by the number of times the ’string’ crosses itself
when the knot is projected onto a plane. For any knot this number of
crossings has a smallest possible value, which is called the number of
crossings.

There exists one prime knot with 3 crossings,

one with 4 crossings,

2 with 5 crossings,

3 with 6 crossings,

7 with 7 crossings,

21 with 8 crossings,

49 with 9 crossings,

165 with 10 crossings.
