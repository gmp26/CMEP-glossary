To construct the centre of a given circle:

pick three points on the circle, A, B and C;

find the perpendicular bisectors of AB ad AC;

mark the intersection, D, of these two bisectors - this is the centre of
the circle.

(Compare the procedure for constructing the circumcircle of a given
triangle).
