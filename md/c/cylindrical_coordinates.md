A three-dimensional coordinate system in which there is one straight
axis, called the z-axis. The other two coordinates are the angle,
measured anticlockwise from some reference direction, and the
perpendicular distance from the z-axis. So this coordinate system is
like two-dimensional polar coordinates, extended to three dimensions by
adding an ordinary z-axis.
