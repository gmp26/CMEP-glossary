The cardinality of a set is the number of elements in the set. For
finite sets this is always a natural number.

Countable infinite sets have cardinality $ \aleph _0 $ (’aleph-null’);
the set of real numbers has cardinality $ \aleph _1 . $

The cardinality of a set A can be written n(A), |A|, or
$ \bar{\mathrm{A}}. $
