The Greek letter $ \delta $ (lower case) or $ \Delta $ (upper case),
equivalent in sound to English ’d’.

Small delta often denotes a quantity which we will let tend to zero, in
analysis; it can also mean the Dirac delta function, or the Kroneker
delta. Large delta may denote the difference between two quantities, the
discriminant of an expression, the ’del’ differential operator.

The word delta is sometimes used to mean a triangle shape - or, less
frequently and incorrectly, to mean a dart or arrowhead shape.
