A distribution $  \delta (x) $ satisfying
$$\delta (x- \xi)=0   \forall x \neq  \xi, \quad  \int_{- \infty }^ \infty  \delta
(x- \xi)=1;$$

It is formally defined as the limit of a sequence of functions
$  \delta _n $ with the second property and
$  \delta _n(0) \to \infty  $ . See also Heaviside function.
