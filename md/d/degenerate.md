A degenerate triangle has all three of its vertices lying on the same
straight line, so the triangle is squashed completely flat; it is hardly
really a triangle at all.

In the same way we can talk about other kinds of degenerate objects,
like a degenerate parabola which is just a line, or a degenerate ellipse
which is just a point.

In general a degenerate object has such parameters that it is not really
recognisable as what it it; it looks like something simpler.
