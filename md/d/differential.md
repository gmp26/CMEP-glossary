A differential is a term like df or dx, used in an expression like ydx -
xdy to denote first-order small changes in f or x, etc. For example, if
f is a function only of x, we have: df = $f'(x_{0})dx.$ And if x is a
function of x and y, then: $ \mathrm{df} = 
\frac{\partial \mathrm{f}}{\partial \mathrm{x}} \mathrm{dx}
+ \frac{\partial \mathrm{f}}{\partial \mathrm{y}} \mathrm{dy} . $
