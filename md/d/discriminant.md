An expression derived from an equation, which gives us some information
about the solutions of the equation.

For instance, the discriminant for a quadratic equation: $ax^{2}$ + bx +
c = 0 is:

d = $b^{2}$ - 4ac.

If d is positive, the equation has two solutions; if d = 0 there is one
solution and if d is negative there are no real solutions.
