- Let $ V $ be a vector space over $  \mathbb{F} $ . The dual of $ V $ ,
written $ V^* $ , is the set of all linear maps
$ f : V \to  \mathbb{F} $ . The operations of addition and scalar
multiplication are defined in the obvious pointwise manner.

- The dual of a set is the set of continuous linear maps
$ f : E \to  \mathbb{C} $ . Note that $ f $ is continuous iff it is
bounded. Such maps are therefore bounded linear functionals.
