A prefix meaning to do with ten (like in decagon, decagram, etc).
Sometimes we find it together with another prefix, to indicate that we
are dealing with a particular number larger than ten. For instance
hexadecimal is to do with sixteen, and a dodecagon has twelve sides.

The symbol da is sometimes used, for example one das is a decasecond, or
ten seconds.
