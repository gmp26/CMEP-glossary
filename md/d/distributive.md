The expression $5 \times (3+6)$ could be calculated in two ways. One way
of calculating it is $5 \times 9$, working out the brackets first, and
giving the answer $45$.

Another way of calculating it could be $(5 \times 3)+(5 \times 6)$ i.e
multiplying everything inside the brackets by $5$, which gives $15+30$,
an answer of $45$.

This demosntrates the fact that multiplication is *distributive* over
addition.
