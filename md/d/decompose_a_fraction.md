To decompose a fraction is to write it as the sum of a set of partial
fractions. The way to do this is first to factorise the denominator, for
instance we decompose $ \frac{1}{6} $ by noting that $6=2 \times 3,$ so
$ \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \times
\frac{1}{3} . $ This means that we can write
$ \frac{1}{6} = \mathrm{A} \frac{1}{2}
+ \mathrm{B} \frac{1}{3} . $

We can find the values of A and B:
$$\frac{1}{6} = \mathrm{A} \frac{1}{2} + \mathrm{B} \frac{1}{3} 
= \frac{ 3 \mathrm{A} + 2 \mathrm{B} } {6}$$
$$\frac{1}{6} = \frac{ 3 \mathrm{A} + 2 \mathrm{B} } {6}$$
$$1 = 3 \mathrm{A} + 2 \mathrm{B}$$

- so one solution is A=1, B=-1.

So, $ \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{3} . $

This method can also work when the fraction has polynomials as numerator
and denominator.
