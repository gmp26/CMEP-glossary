Dimensions are the independent directions in which we can make
measurements. For instance, in a plane there are two dimensions, because
once we have chosen two different directions x and y we can represent
any other direction as being a bit of x added to a bit of y.

Often when we talk about dimensions we simply mean dimensions of space,
but sometimes we talk about other quantities as dimensions too.

Sometimes we talk about the dimensions of an object, meaning its size in
various directions.

Scientists talk about the dimension of a number, meaning the type of
quantity (eg length, area, time) which it measures.
