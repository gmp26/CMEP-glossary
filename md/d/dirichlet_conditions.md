Sufficiency conditions for a ‘well-behaved’ periodic function $ f(x) $
with period $ 2L $ to have a convergent Fourier series. These are that
$ f $ must be bounded and have a finite number of maxima, minima and
discontinuities for $ x \in [0,2L) $ ; then the Fourier series will
converge to $ f $ wherever it is continuous, and at a jump discontinuity
it will converge to the midpoint of the two one-sided limits. Not that
these are not necessary conditions, for example $ f(x)= sin(1/x) $ does
have a convergent Fourier series.
