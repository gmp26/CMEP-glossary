The position of an astronomical object can be described by two numbers,
corresponding to latitude and longitude on the earth’s surface. One way
of doing this is using right ascension and declination:

We call the circle of the sun’s path in the sky, the ecliptic. This
corresponds to the earth’s equator (but it is **not** parallel to it).
Then the declination is the angle that an object is away from the
ecliptic (corresponding to latitude).
