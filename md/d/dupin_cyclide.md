The envelope of all spheres touching three given fixed spheres. (Each of
the fixed spheres is to be touched in an assigned manner, either
externally or internally.)

Equivalently, the envelope of all spheres whose centres lie on a given
conic and which touch a given sphere.

Also equivalently, the inverse of a torus.
