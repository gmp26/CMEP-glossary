A directed number can be either positive or negative in character. They
are used for counting and measuring in two opposite senses.

Positive numbers are numbers that are bigger than zero and are sometimes
written with a small + placed in front of them <span>+1, +2, +3,

written with a small -placed in front of
them<span>......-101......-78....-64......-47.....-25... ............-6,
