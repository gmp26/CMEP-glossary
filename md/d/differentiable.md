Able to be differentiated. f(x) is differentiable at x=a if the limit
defining the derivative of f(a) exists.

Most - but not all - continuous functions are differentiable.

All differentiable functions are continuous.

If a function contains sudden jumps, or has sharp corners, or has places
where the slope is infinite, then it will not normally be
differentiable. (For instance, note that f(x)=|x| is not differentiable
at x=0.)
