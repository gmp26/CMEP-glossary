We say that a system has n degrees of freedom if it takes n variables to
describe what state it is in at a particular moment. For example, a
billiard ball on a table has four degrees of freedom: its x- and
y-coordinates on the table, and its velocity in the x- and y-
directions. These four pieces of information tell us everything about
its state. (If we consider that it may be spinning as well, it has extra
degrees of freedom.)
