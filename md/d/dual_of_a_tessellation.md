Given a tessellation, replace each tile with a point at its centre, and
each edge between tiles with an edge joining vertices. This gives the
dual of the original tessellation.

The dual of a regular tessellation is a regular tessellation; the dual
of a semi-regular tessellation is not semi-regular.
