We know that $(x+y)(x-y)=x^{2}-xy+xy-y^{2}$ (by multiplying out the
brackets).

But this is the same as $x^{2}-y^{2}.$ So whenever we have an expression
like $x^{2}-y^{2}$ we can write it as (x+y)(x-y). This result is often
useful for simplifying algebra; it is called the difference of two
squares.

For example: $6^2-5^2=(6+5)(6-5)=11 \times 1 =11.$

$17^2-15^2=(17+15)(17-15)=32 \times 1 =64.$
