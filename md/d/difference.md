The amount by which one quantity is greater than or less than another
quantity.

When comparing other items the differences could include being bigger or
smaller; fatter or thinner; longer or shorter; colder or warmer; higher
or lower; etc.

When we have a sequence of numbers we are often interested in the
pattern of differences between the numbers.
