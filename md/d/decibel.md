A unit for comparing two powers, equal to one-tenth of a bel - so the
number of decibels is ten times the common logarithm of the ratio of the
two powers.

The symbol used is dB.

The decibel is used for measuring sounds; the number of decibels is ten
times the common logarithm of the ratio of intensities between the sound
we are measuring and some reference sound. The reference sound is
usually the quietest audible sound of that frequency.
