An equation which gives a relationship between the values of the terms
in a sequence and the differences between them. A recurrence relation is
a special kind of difference equation.

More generally, a difference equation is any equation involving the
terms of a sequence. The techniques for solving them, to find out what
the sequence is, are related to the techniques for solving differential
equations.
