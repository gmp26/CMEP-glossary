The 46th uniform polyhedron is the Ditrigonal dodecadodecahedron; it has
Wythoff symbol 3|5/3 5. Its dual is the medial triambic icosahedron. The
pattern of polygons round each vertex is (5/3,5,5/3,5,5/3,5); its
symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.

It has:

Euler characteristic: -16

Density: 4

Number of vertices: 20

Number of edges: 60

Number of faces: 24 (=12 pentagons and 12<span>5/3</span>).

Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining
every $b^{th}$ of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made
by taking five points and joining every second point.
