The length of time it takes the earth to go once round the sun; usually
thought of as 365 days for calendar purposes, it is actually 365.2425
days on average when leap years are taken into account (a leap year has
366 days; they occur when the year number is divisible by four - but if
the year number is divisible by 100, it must also be divisible by 400 in
order to be a leap year) - which is close to the true value of just over
365.2424.

Extra seconds are inserted on New Yearâ€™s Eve, to keep the year exactly
in line with the seasons; sometimes you can hear the speaking clock make
seven pips rather than the usual six, when this happens.
