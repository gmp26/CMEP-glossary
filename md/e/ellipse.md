A shape that looks like a flattened circle.

It can obtained by making a slanting cut through the side of a cone.

Shapes that look like an ellipse are said to be elliptical.

The general equation of an ellipse given parametrically is:
$$x(t)=acos(t)\quad y(t)=asin(t)$$ 
and in Cartesian coordinates:
$$\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{b^2}=1$$
