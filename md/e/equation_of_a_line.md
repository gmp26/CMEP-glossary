In two dimensions:

A straight line that crosses the y-axis at y=c and has gradient m, has
equation y=mx+c.

The straight line that passes through points (a,b) and (c,d) has
equation (x-a)/(x-c)=(y-b)/(y-d).

In three dimensions:

A straight line that passes through points (a,b,c) and (d,e,f) has
equation (x-a)/(x-d)=(y-b)/(y-e)=(z-c)/(z-f).

A lineâ€™s equation can also be written y=mx+c, z=nx+d. This line
intersects the y,z plane at y=c, z=d.
