The equation of any non-vertical plane can be written in the form
$z=mx+ny+c$. The plane intersects the $z$-axis at $z=c$.

It is more usual to write the equation of a plane using vectors.

Given a point $A$ with position vector $\mathbf{a}$ and a normal vector
$\mathbf{n}$, the plane perpendicular to $\mathbf{n}$ through
$\mathbf{a}$ has cartesian equation: $n_{1}x+n_{2}y+n_{3}z + d=0$, where
$d = -\mathbf{a.n}$.
