Distribution of waiting time, distribution of the time between (rare)
events.

A continuous distribution for a random variable taking positive values,
with frequency function:
$$\mathrm{f(x)} = \lambda \mathrm{e}^{- \lambda \mathrm{x}} .$$ It has
mean $ 1/ \lambda $ and variance $ 1/ \lambda ^2 . $

This distribution is a special case of the gamma distribution.

It has MGF $ M ( \theta ) = \frac{\lambda}{\lambda - \theta} . $
