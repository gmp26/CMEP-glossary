A measure of how much disorder there is in a system; it is related to
the probability of the system being in a state which is
indistinguishable from the one it is in. So a highly organised, unusual
state has low entropy, but an ordinary state that looks the same as
millions of others has high entropy.

The second law of thermodynamics states that on average, the entropy of
the universe always increases, i.e. we move from organised states to
less organised ones (things wear out and break, hot things cool down and
cold ones warm up...)
