Given a mass at the end of a string, resting on a horizontal surface, if
we pull the other end of the string in a straight line the path the mass
describes is called a tractrix. It has equations: x=sech(t),
y=t-tanh(t).

The straight line is the asymptote of the tractrix; the starting point
of the mass is its vertex.

The tractrix is orthogonal to a set of equal circles having their
centres on a straight line.
