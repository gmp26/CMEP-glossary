A curve or a surface which touches every member of a family of lines,
curves, planes or surfaces.

A family of curves in two dimensions f(x,y,t)=0 (where t is a parameter)
has an envelope whose equation can be found by solving simultaneously:

$$\begin{aligned}
  f(x,y,p)&=&0 \\
  \frac{\partial}{\partial p } f(x,y,p) &=& 0\end{aligned}$$
