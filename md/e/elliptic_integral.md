An integral of the form
$$\int \mathrm{f} ( \mathrm{x}, \sqrt{\mathrm{R}} ) \mathrm{dx} ,$$
where R is a cubic or a quartic in x, and f is a rational functionof its
two arguments.

Any elliptic integral can be written as a sum of multiples of an
elementary function, and the three standard types of elliptic integral.

These integral were first used in finding the circumference of an
ellipse.
