The energy which a spring or other elastic body has because of its
extension or compression.

A body of stiffness k under extension x stores energy $E=kx^{2}/2.$

A body with modulus of elasticity $ \lambda $ with original length
$l_{0}$ and extension x stores energy
$ E = \frac{1}{2} \frac{ \lambda }{l_0} x ^2 . $
