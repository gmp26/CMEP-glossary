A conic section can be described as the locus of a point P whose
distance PS from a fixed point S is in some fixed ratio to its
perpendicular distance PN from a fixed line. This fixed ratio is then
called the eccentricity of the conic.

For an ellipse, it is a measure of how much it differs from a circle.
