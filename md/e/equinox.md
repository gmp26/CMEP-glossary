The time when the earthâ€™s axis of rotation is perpendicular to the line
joining the earth and the sun. This happens twice a year, on about 21st
March and 23rd September.

At this time neither hemisphere of the earth is pointing towards the
earth more than the other, so it is spring or autumn everywhere, not
summer or winter. Night and day are the same length.
