A (right circular) cone whose base is a circle of radius $r$ centred at
the origin, lying in the $x$, $y$ plane, and whose axis is in the
$z$-direction with length $h$, can be described by two formulas. The
circular base has $z=0, x^2+y^2 < r^2.$ The curved surface has
$x^2+y^2=(r-(rz/h))^2,$ for z in the range [0, h].
