A way of finding the highest common factor of two different numbers:

​1) Divide the larger number by the smaller.

​2) If the division can be done exactly then the HCF is the smaller
number. If there is a remainder then the HCF is the same as the HCF of
the remainder and the smaller number - so repeat step 1 with these two
numbers.

For instance, to find HCF(17, 20):

20/17 = 1, with remainder 3

so the HCF is the same as HCF(17, 3):

17/3 = 6 with remainder 1

so the HCF is the same as HCF(3, 1):

3/1 = 3; this is exact, so the HCF is 1.
