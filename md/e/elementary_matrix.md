A matrix A is called elementary if the effect on B of multiplying B by A
is to perform some elementary row or column operation on B. i.e. if AB
is the same as B, but with two rows or columns swapped, or one row or
column multiplied by a constant, or a multiple of one row or column
added to another row or column, then A is elementary.
