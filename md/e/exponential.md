The exponential function takes a number, and gives as output e raised to
the power of that number, where e is the constant e = 2.718281828...

In other words, the exponential of x, written exp(x), is $e^{x}.$ This
is the inverse function of the natural logarithm function.

Sometimes we use the function $exp_{10}(x),$ which is $10^{x}$ and is
the inverse function of $log_{10}.$

In general, exponentiation can mean raising something to the power of
something else.
