Euclid’s five basic assumptions, on which he built his geometry:

A straight line can be drawn between any pair of points;

A straight line may be continued indefinitely in any direction;

For any centre, and any radius, a circle may be drawn;

All right angles are equal;

Given a line and a point not on the line, exactly one line may be drawn
through the given point parallel to the given line.

The last of these, also known as Playfair’s axiom, is independent of the
others and may be altered to give different, non-Euclidean geometries.
It was originally stated in a different form, equivalent to:

Given straight lines A and B, and a line C intersecting them, if the
interior angles formed on the same side of C total less than two right
angles, then A and B produced must meet on this side of C.
