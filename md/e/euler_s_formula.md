-   The formula $e^{\mathrm{i}x}  = \cos x + \mathrm{i} \sin x$, where
    $\mathrm{i}$ is the square root of -1. A special case is
    $ \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}\pi } = -1. $

-   The formula, also called Eulerâ€™s theorem: V - E + F = 2, which
    relates the number of vertices V, edges E, and faces F in a
    polyhedron.
