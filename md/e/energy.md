In physics, energy is the ability to do work; the capacity for doing
work. This could be work that would be done by a particleâ€™s motion, or
by its chemical properties, or by a change of position; these are
called, respectively, kinetic energy, chemical energy, potential energy.
Other types of energy are similarly named, to indicate how a system
could be made to do work.
