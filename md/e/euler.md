Leonhard Euler(1707 - 1783) was a Swiss mathematician who is famous for
much work in mathematics in particular for his studies of polyhedra,
about which he discovered a rule:

The number of Vertices + the number of Faces - the number of Edges = 2

This formula also applies to networks: the number of Nodes + the number
of Regions - the number of Arcs = 2
