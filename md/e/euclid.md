Euclid:

A Greek mathematician(born c. 300BC) famous for his work on Geometry,
especially his book called *The Elements*. He devised a geometry dealing
with points, lines and planes based on some specific assumptions, that:

-   a line can go through any two points

-   a line can be extended indefinitely in both directions

-   all right angles are equal

-   one line only can be drawn parallel to a given line through a point
    not on the line.
