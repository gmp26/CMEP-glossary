A sample space in which each one of a finite number of possible outcomes
is equally likely.

Note that not all sample spaces are uniform; for instance if we toss a
coin three times and measure the outcome by the number of heads we
obtain, then the sample space is <span>0, 1, 2, 3</span> but these are
not all equally likely: p(0)=1/8, but p(1)=3/8, for instance.

Whether or not we can find a uniform sample space for a given
experiment, it is usually best to keep as much information about
individual outcomes as we can when constructing the sample space.
