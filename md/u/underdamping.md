A damped harmonic system $ \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} + \alpha \frac{dx}{dt} 
+ \omega ^2 x = 0  $ is described as underdamped if
$ \alpha < 2 \omega . $

In this case the equation is solved by
$ x = a e^{ - \alpha t / 2 } \sin ( \rho t + epsilon ) , $ where
$ \rho = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt { 4 \omega ^2 - \alpha ^2 } . $

The system oscillates forever, the amplitude of the oscillations
becoming exponentially smaller over time.
