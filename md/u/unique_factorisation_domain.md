Abbreviation: UFD. An integral domain $ R $ in which every $ a \neq 0 $
has a factorisation $ a=up_1 \ldots p_k $ , unique up to units $ u $ and
permutation of primes $ p_1, \ldots , p_k $ (note that in a UFD, the
notions of primeness and irreducibility are identical).

Every principal ideal domain is a UFD, but not vice versa, e.g.
$  {Z}[X] $ is a UFD but not a PID, as $  \langle 2,X \rangle $ is not a
principal ideal.
