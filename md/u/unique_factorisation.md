The unique factorisation of a number is the way of writing that number
as a product of prime numbers and powers of prime numbers, in ascending
order. For instance, the unique factorisation of 360 is
$2^{3} \times 3^{2} \times 5.$ It is called unique because, for a given
number, there is always only one way of doing this.
