A uniform polyhedron is a polyhedron which has the same pattern of faces
around each vertex. Assuming that only two faces are allowed to meet at
an edge, there are 75 such polyhedra. All but one of them can be
specified by a Wythoff symbol.

The vertices of such a polyhedron lie on a sphere. The centre of the
sphere is the centroid of the polyhedron. For a given vertex, the set of
vertices joined to it by an edge lie on a circle.
