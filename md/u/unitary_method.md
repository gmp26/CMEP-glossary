Certain problems in variation can be solved by reducing one of the
variables to 1, and then increasing it back again to the required value.

For instance if we know that a and b are proportional to one another,
and that when a=7, b=10, and we are required to find the value of a when
b=7, then we may proceed as follows: a=7 when b=10, so a=7/10 when b=1,
so a=49/10 when b=7.

This is called a unitary method.
