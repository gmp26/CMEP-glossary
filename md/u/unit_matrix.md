A diagonal matrix in which every element on the leading diagonal is
equal to 1 (and every element not on the leading diagonal is equal to
zero). It is denoted by the symbol I. It leaves other matrices unchanged
when it is multiplied by them, so it can be thought of as an identity
operator or an identity element.
