An ordered set of four numbers. Sometimes a quaternion is written in the
form $x_{0}+ix_{1}+jx_{2}+kx_{3};$ sometimes it is considered to be a
scalar and a three-component vector.

Quaternions written as above can be added and multiplied, using the
laws:

$$\begin{aligned}
  i^{2} & = j^{2} = & k^{2} = -1 \\
  ij & = k = & -ji \\
  jk & = i = & -kj \\
  ki & = j = & -ik.\end{aligned}$$

The set of quaternions is a 4-dimensional vector space over
$ \mathbb{R} . $ A basis of this space is 1, i, j, k.
