Those points 1/5, 2/5, 3/5 and 4/5 of the way through a frequency
distribution are called the quintiles. For instance, the first quintile
is the point with 1/5 of the data below it and 4/5 above it. The word
can also refer to the subset of data falling between two of these
points. For instance, the middle quintile is the subset of the data
falling between 2/5 and 3/5 of the way through the sample.
