If something is quadratic, it contains the variable squared, but not
raised to any higher power. For instance a quadratic equation in x
contains $x^{2} but not x^{3}.$ Similarly a quadratic expression, or a
quadratic form, contains its variable(s) squared but not raised to any
higher power.

If there is more than one variable, quadratic can mean that they are
multiplied together in pairs but not in threes.
