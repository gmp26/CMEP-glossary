For a given line L and a point P, if we draw a line through P
perpendicular to L, then this line will intersect L at a point Q. Q is
called the foot of the perpendicular line.

Similarly if we draw an altitude of a triangle or another figure, the
point where an altitude meets the side to which it is perpendicular is
called the foot of the altitude.
