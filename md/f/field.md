A set F with two commutative and associative operations, + and
$ \times ,$ such that:

1)if a and b are in F then a+b and $a \times b$ are in F;

2)+ has an identity, 0, and $ \times $ has an identity, 1, and these are
not the same;

3)every element has an inverse under +, and every element but 0 has an
inverse under $ \times ;$

$4) \times $ is distributive over +.

$ \mathbb {Q,R,C} $ are all fields with the operations of addition and
multiplication.

The definition can also be written: F is a commutative group under
addition; F/<span>0</span> is a commutative group under multiplication;
multiplication is distributive over addition.
