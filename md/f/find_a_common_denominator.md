If we are given a set of fractions a/b, c/d, e/f, ... we can find a
common denominator for them by multiplying together the denominators b,
d, f, ...

Eg for 3/4, 4/5, 5/6 have common denominator $4 \times 5 \times 6=120$.

This is not the lowest common denominator, as 60 is a multiple of 4, 5
and 6.
