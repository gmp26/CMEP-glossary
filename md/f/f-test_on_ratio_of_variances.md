This is a test of the null hypothesis that two populationsâ€™ variances
are in the ratio r. We have two samples of sizes m, n, and we compute
unbiased estimates of the population variances $s^{2}, t^{2}$ using
divisors m-1, n-1. The distribution used is F with parameters m-1, n-1,
and the test statistic is $ \frac{1}{r} \frac{s^2}{t^2} . $ Note that we
assume the populations are normal, and we should have r less than 1 and
s greater than t.

A special case has r=1, in which case this is a test for equality of
variances.
