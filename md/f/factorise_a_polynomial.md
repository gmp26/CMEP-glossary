To factorise a polynomial is to write it as the product of a set of
smaller polynomials (ie polynomials whose highest power of x is smaller
than that of the polynomial we started with).

For instance we might factorise $x^{2}-3x-10$ by writing it as
(x-5)(x+2).

Or we can factorise $x^{3}-2x^{2}-15x by writing it as (x^{2}+3x)(x-5)$
or $(x^{2}-5x)(x+3)$ or x(x-5)(x+3), etc.

If c is a root of the polynomial then (x-c) is a factor of it; for
quadratic, cubic and quartic polynomials this can be useful for
factorising. But there is no general way to factorise any polynomial
quickly.
