A shorthand way of writing down a special whole number:

Four factorial or Factorial four is written 4! and means
$$4\cdot 3\cdot 3\cdot 1$$, which equals 24

Six factorial 6! = 720.

Factorials grow very quickly: 1! = 1; 2! = 2; 3! = 6; 4! = 24; 5! = 120;
6! = 720; 7! = 5040; 8! = 40320; 9! = 362880

(0 is special; 0!=1, not zero as you might expect.)
