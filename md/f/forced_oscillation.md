A simple harmonic system is called forced if it is subject to a force
whose size varies sinusoidally over time. It is described by the
equation
$ \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} + \omega ^2 x = a \omega ^2 \sin ( \Omega t ) $
(undamped)

or $ \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} + \alpha \frac{dx}{dt} + \omega ^2 x
= a \omega ^2 \sin ( \Omega t ) $ (damped).

If $ \Omega = \omega , $ resonance occurs, and in the case of undamped
motion the amplitude of the oscillations will grow without limit.
