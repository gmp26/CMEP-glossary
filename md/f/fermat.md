Pierre de Fermat (1601-1665): A French mathematician most frequently
remembered for Fermatâ€™s Last Theorem - he famously claimed to have a
proof of this theorem, but did not write it down.

He was a professional lawyer but an extremely talented amateur
mathematician.

He worked on maxima and minima and tangents, spirals, loci, and number
theory. He is considered to be the co-inventor of analytic geometry,
together with Descartes. He is one of the earlies pioneers in
probability.
