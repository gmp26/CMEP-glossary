A number of the form $ 2^{2^{\mathrm{n}}}+1 $ is called a Fermat number.
The first few are 3, 5, 17, 257, 65537...

The first five Fermat numbers are primes, but the sixth is not. It is
not known whether any other Fermat numbers are primes, although it is
known that every Fermat number is coprime to every other.

Interestingly, a polygon with n sides can be constructed using only
compasses and straightedge, if and only if n is a product of distinct
Fermat numbers and/or powers of 2.

All Fermat numbers are mutually coprime. The only triangular Fermat
number is $F_{0}=3.$ No Fermat number is a square or a cube.
