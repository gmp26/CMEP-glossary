A functional equation is an equation which involves an unknown function
which is applied to two or more different values of the variable.

For instance: f(x+1)=xf(x).

This is like a recurrence relation, but with a function (of the real
numbers) instead of a sequence. In order to solve a functional equation
we must find an expression for f(x) in terms of x.
