A sequence $u_{n}$ with the property that $u_{i}+u_{i+1}=u_{i+2}$ for
every i.

Usually we also require that $u_{0}=u_{1}=1.$

The sequence begins: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55

The numbers in this sequence are called Fibonacci numbers, and the
equation defining the sequence is called the Fibonacci equation.
