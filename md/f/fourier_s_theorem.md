If we have a function f(x) which is continuous except possibly at a
finite number of finite discontinuities, defined on the interval
$ [ - \pi , \pi ] $ and with only a finite number of maxima and minima
in that interval, then it is possible to find a convergent Fourier
series to represent the function in that interval.
