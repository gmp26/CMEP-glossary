The problem which asks whether there exists any network of lines and
points in a plane which requires more than four colours in order to
colour it in such a way that adjacent regions always have different
colours.

In 1976 it was proved that four colours is always sufficient to do this,
but the proof involved using a computer to check a large number of
possible small networks - it would have taken too long for a human to
check the proof, so some mathematicians feel that this proof is not
acceptable.

On different kinds of surfaces the number of colours required is
different. On the surface of a torus it is seven.
