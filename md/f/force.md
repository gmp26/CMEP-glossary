An influence that causes an object to accelerate. The size of the
acceleration is proportional to the size of the force, and inversely
proportional to the mass of the object; this is Newtonâ€™s second law of
motion.

Force is a vector quantity; its size is measured in Newtons. One Newton
will make a body of mass 1kg accelerate from rest to 1 metre per second,
in a time of one second.

Force has dimensions $MLT^{-2}.$ The Newton is the SI unit of force.
