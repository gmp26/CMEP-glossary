Given a triangle ABC, the Fermat point is the point P inside the
triangle for which the sum AP+BP+CP is a minimum.

It turns out that this point is the point of intersection of the three
lines which join A, B and C with the opposite vertices of the Napoleon
triangles of the given triangle - as long as this point is inside the
triangle.
