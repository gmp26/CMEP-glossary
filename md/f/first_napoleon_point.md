If we are given a triangle ABC, we can construct three equilateral
triangles, outside ABC, one standing one each side of ABC. This defines
three new points: D, E, F, with triangles BCD, CAE and ABF equilateral.
Now let G, H, I be the centres of these three equilateral triangles.
Then the lines AG, BH, CI meet in a point which is called the first
Napoleon point.

Note that there is another Napoleon point called the second Napoleon
point.
