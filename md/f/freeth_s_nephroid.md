If we have a given circle C, with centre O, and point K on its
circumference, then Freeth’s nephroid can be drawn as follows:

Draw a line l through K, meeting the circle at Q. Find points P and P’
on l such that QP=QP’=QO. The locus of P and P’ as l moves is the
nephroid.

In other words, this curve is the strophoid of a circle, using the
circle’s centre as pole and taking a fixed point on the circumference of
the circle.
