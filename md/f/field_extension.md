Of a given field, a field containing it.

Write $ L/K $ to mean “L extends K”; we say that $ L $ is a finite
extension if its dimension as a vector space over $ K $ is finite. If it
is also separable, then in fact $ L=K( \alpha ) $ for some
$  \alpha  \in L $ (the theorem of the primitive element). The field
$ K $ may be referred to as the base field of $ L $ .
