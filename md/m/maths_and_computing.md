Computer science is closely related to mathematics, and maths is often
needed in order to study the way that a computational process will work
or the most efficient way to do something.

Conversely, in modern mathematics we can often use computers to make
things easier, for instance in finding approximate solutions,
manipulating complicated pieces of algebra or even checking parts of
complicated proofs that are too large to do by hand.
