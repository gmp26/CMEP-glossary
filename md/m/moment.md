A moment is a force acting around a point; for instance a force loading
a lever causes a moment about the leverâ€™s pivot point. A force $F$
acting along a line whose minimum distance from point $P$ is $d$, causes
a moment $M=Fd$ about the point $P$. A force $\mathbf{F}$ acting at a
point with position vector $\mathbf{r}$ has moment
$\mathbf{L} = \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{F}$ about the origin. Moment has
dimensions $ML^{2}T^{-2}$ and SI unit Nm, Newton metres.
