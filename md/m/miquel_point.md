If we draw four lines in the plane so that they intersect in six points
and form three triangles, then we can draw the circumcircles of these
three triangles. The circles will intersect in a single point, which is
called the Miquel point of the lines.

The Miquel point is also the focus of a parabola drawn tangent to each
of the lines.
