Given a triangular prism of marble, what are the three cylindrical
columns with greatest total volume which can be cut from it?

This is equivalent to asking, what are the three circles with greatest
total area which can be inscribed in a given triangle.

The solution depends on the shape of the triangle; for triangles close
to equilateral the incircle plus two smaller circles in two of the
corners is best. For a long thin triangle, three circles stacked at the
broad end is best. One of these arrangements is always the best
possible.
