Menelaus of Alexandria (c70-c130) wrote a number of books, only one of
which survives (The Book of Spherical Propositions). It is the first
place that the definition of a spherical triangle is given; Menelaus was
interested in the applications of spherical triangles to astronomy, and
in spherical trigonometry.

He is mainly remembered for Menelausâ€™ theorem, which is named after him,
although the version of this theorem which deals with plane triangles
was known before Menelaus. He is credited with discovering the version
for spherical triangles.

It is thought that Menelaus was interested in mechanics, particularly
specific gravities, but his writings on this subject have not survived.
