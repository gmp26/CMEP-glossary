This is a test of the null hypothesis that two samples drawn from
similarly-shaped distribution are drawn from the *same* distribution,
against the alternative hypothesis that the populations have different
locations.

The sample statistic is $T=W-m(m+1)/2$, where $W$ is the sum of ranks of
the smaller sample, and $m$ is the size of this sample. Tables are given
for use with this test.
