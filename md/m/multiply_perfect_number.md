A number n whose divisors sum to a multiple of n. An example is 120,
whose divisors (including itself) sum to $360=3 \times 120.$

If the divisors sum to 3n, n is called multiply perfect of order 3, or
tri-perfect. So orinary perfect numbers are multiply perfect of order 2.

Multiply perfect numbers are known of order up to 8.
