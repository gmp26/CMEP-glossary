The length of time it takes the moon to go round the earth,
approximately.

About a twelfth of a year, or a little more than four weeks.

In our calendar, the months are not all the same length; they vary from
28 to 31 days. Months are used in calendars to divide the year up in
order to refer to parts of it more easily; a month is not really a unit
of time.
