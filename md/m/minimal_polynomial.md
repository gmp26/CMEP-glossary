If A is a matrix representing a linear map, then given any polynomial p,
p(A) is also a matrix representing a linear map.

We call a polynomial p a minimal polynomial for A if:

p(A)=0;

the degree of p is smaller than or equal to that of any other polynomial
q that has q(A)=0;

the leading coefficient of p is 1; is p is monic.

It can be shown that there is precisely one minimal polynomial for A.
