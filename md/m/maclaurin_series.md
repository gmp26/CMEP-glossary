A special kind of Taylor series, of the form:
$$f(x)=f(0)+f\prime(0)x+f\prime\prime(0)x^{2}/2+f\prime\prime\prime(0)x^{3}/3!+... +f^{(n-1)}(0)x^{n-1}/(n-1)!+R_{n}.$$
(This is a Taylor series with $a=0.$) Maclaurinâ€™s theorem states the
conditions under which such a series exists for a function $f$. $R_{n}$
is a remainder term, and can be written in the same forms as that of a
Taylor series.
