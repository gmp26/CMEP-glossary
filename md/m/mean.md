The mean or arithmetic mean is one measure of the centre of a set of
data. The mean is calculated by adding up all the values and dividing
the total by the total number of values.

For example, when the values 7, 4, 6, 5, 7, 7, 6 are added the sum is
42. The mean is calculated by dividing 42 by the number of values (7),
giving a mean of 6.

The arithmetic mean is sensitive to outlier values.
