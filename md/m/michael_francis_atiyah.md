Michael Francis Atiyah (1929-): An English mathematician who has
contributed to many topics in mathematics, notably dealing with the
relationships between geometry and analysis. In topology, he developed
K-theory. He proved the ’index theorem’ on the number of solutions of
elliptic differential equations, linking differential geometry,
topology, and analysis - this theorem can be applied to quantum theory,
where it has been useful.

He was influential in initiating work on gauge theories and applications
to nonlinear differential equations, and in making links between
topology and quantum field theory.

Theories of superspace and supergravity, and string theory, were all
developed using ideas introduced by Atiyah.
