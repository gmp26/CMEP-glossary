A measure of how hard it is to get an object to turn about a particular
axis. It depends on the way the object’s mass is distributed about the
axis.

In particular, in the equation of rotational motion
$ M=I \overset{..}{\theta} , $ where M is the resultant moment on a
system and $ \overset{..}{\theta} $ is its angular acceleration, I, the
moment of inertia, is the ratio connecting the two. (Compare this with
Newton’s second law: F=ma.)

Moment of inertia has dimensions $ML^{2} and SI unit kgm^{2}.$
