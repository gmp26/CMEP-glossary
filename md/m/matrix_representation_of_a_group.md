A matrix representation of a group is a set of matrices which is
homomorphic to the group.

So for a group G a representation H has the property that if
$g_{1} and g_{2}$ are in G and the homomorphism taking G to H is f, then
$f(g_{1}g_{2})=f(g_{1})*f(g_{2})$ where \* represents matrix
multiplication.
