If $f(x)$ is continuous for $ a \leq x \leq b $ and differentiable for
$a < x < b$, then there is some value of $x$ between $a$ and $b$, say
$c$, for which: $$\frac{\mathrm{d}f}{\mathrm{dx}}(c) = 
  \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}$$ i.e. there is a point where the tangent to
$f(x)$ is parallel to the straight line joining $(a,f(a))$ and
$(b,f(b))$.
