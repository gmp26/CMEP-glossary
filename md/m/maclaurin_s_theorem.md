The special case of Taylorâ€™s theorem when a=0, i.e.

for a given function f whose $(n-1)^{th}$ derivative is continuous in
[0,b] and whose $n^{th}$ derivative exists in (0,b), we can write f(x)
as a Taylor series ie:
$$f(x)=f(0)+f\prime(0)x+f\prime\prime(0)x^{2}/2+f\prime\prime\prime(0)x^{3}/3!+... +f^{(n-1)}(0)x^{n-1}/(n-1)!+R_{n}.$$
($x$ must lie in $[0,b]$.) $R^{n}$ is a remainder term; it can be
written in various forms; its value is usually small.
