A kind of average value. It is the element that occurs most frequently
in some data.

E.g. In the class test the marks scored were:

5, 7, 8, 1, 3, 5, 7, 3, 4, 8, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 3, 5, 8, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9,
9, 2, 4, 8, 3, 6, 7, 8.

If you look carefully at the results you should see that the mode of
this data, the score that appears most often, is a mark of 8.

A set of data can have more than one mode.
