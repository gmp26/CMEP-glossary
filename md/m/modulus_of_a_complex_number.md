The modulus of $z \in \mathbb{C}$ is given by $|z|=\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}$,
where $x,y \in \mathbb{R}$ and $z=x+iy$.

$|z|$ is the distance $r$ of $z$ from the origin $0$. When $z$ is
expressed in polar coordinates, $z = re^{i\theta} =
  |z|e^{i\theta}$.

It is sometimes convenient to calculate $|z|$ using the complex
conjugate $z^{*}= x - iy$ since $|z|^2 = zz^*$.
