A method of solving certain numerical problems by using a lot of random
samples to estimate the true value of a quantity.

For instance we might estimate the probability of getting a certain hand
of cards, by dealing a thousand hands at random and seeing how often the
required hand turned up. (The method is named after the famous resort in
France.)
