A rectangular lamina with one pair of edges of length 2l, about an axis
in its own plane, bisecting the edges of length 2l, has moment of
inertia $Ml^{2}/3$ where M is the mass.

About an edge perpendicular to the edges of length 2l, it has moment of
inertia $4Ml^{2}/3.$

If the sides have lengths 2a and 2b, then about a perpendicular axis
through its centre it has moment of inertia $M(a^{2}+b^{2})/3.$
