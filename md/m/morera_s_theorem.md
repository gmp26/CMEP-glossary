For a star shaped domain $ D $ , if $ f : D \to  \mathbb{C} $ is
continuous and $$\int_{ \partial T} f(z) dz=0$$ for all triangles $ T $
with boundary $  \partial T $ , then $ f $ is holomorphic. This has an
easy extension to any domain, since we can find a star shaped region
within it. Compare Cauchyâ€™s theorem.
