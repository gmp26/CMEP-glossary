The force on an elastic body is proportional to the ratio of the bodyâ€™s
extension to its original length; the constant of proportionality is
called the modulus of elasticity.

It has symbol $ \lambda , $ dimensions $MLT^{-2}$ and SI unit N, Newton.

It is constant for bodies of a particular material with a given
cross-section.
