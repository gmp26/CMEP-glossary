Let R be a ring. A right R-module (or simply a module over R) is an
additive abelian group, M, with a scalar multiplication
$ M \times R \rightarrow M $ satisfying:

(a+b)r=ar+br;

a(r+p)=ar+ap;

a(rp)=(ar)p;

a1=a,

where a and b are in M, r and p are in R, and 1 is the identity element
of R.

(Note that if, instead, R were a field, we would have a vector space.)
