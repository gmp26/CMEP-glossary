Given a number, multiply its digits together to obtain a new number.
Repeat this process until we reach a single digit. The number of steps
taken to reach a single digit is called the multiplicative persistence
of the original number.

For example, $ 679 \to 378 \to 168 \to 48 \to 32 \to 6 , $ so 679 has
multiplicative persistence 5.
