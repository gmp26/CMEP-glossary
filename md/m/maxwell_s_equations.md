The equations which govern the behaviour of electrical and magnetic
fields:

$$\begin{aligned}
  \nabla . \mathrm{B} &=& 0 \\
  \nabla \times \mathrm{E} + \frac{\partial \mathrm{B}}{\partial \mathrm{t}} &=& 0 \\
  \nabla . \mathrm{D} &=& \rho \\
  \nabla \times \mathrm{H} - \frac{\partial \mathrm{D}}{\partial \mathrm{t}} &=& 
\mathrm{J} \\end{aligned}$$

(Factors of $c$, etc, may arise in the equations depending on the system
of units. The above are for MKSA units.)

$\mathrm{E}$ is the electric field.

$ \mathrm{D} = \epsilon_{0} \mathrm{E} + \mathrm{P} $ is the
displacement where $ \epsilon_{0} $ is the permittivity of free space
and $\mathrm{P}$ is the polarisation.

$\mathrm{B}$ is the magnetic induction or flux density,

$ \mathrm{H} = \frac{\mathrm{B}}{\mu
_{0}} - \mathrm{M} $ is the magnetic field where $ \mu _{0} $ is the
permeability of free space and $\mathrm{M}$ is the magnetisation.

$ \rho $ is the electric charge density.

$\mathrm{J}$ is the current density.

In a linear isotropic medium $\mathrm{P}=\mathrm{M}=0$, and $ \epsilon $
and $ \mu $ are constants, but in general $\mathrm{H}$ and $\mathrm{D}$
will depend on the earlier behaviour of the system.

Note also that $ \frac{1}{\epsilon_{0} \mu_{0}} = c^2 $ where $c$ is the
speed of light in a vacuum.
