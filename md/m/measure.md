A measure is a property of certain sets. For a collection of subsets
$A_{i},$ a measure m is a function
$ m : \{ A_i \} \mapsto \mathbb{R}^{+} \cup
\{ + \infty \} , $ with the following properties:

$ m ( \emptyset ) = 0 ; $

If all of $\{  A_{i_{n}} \} $ are disjoint, then
$ m \left ( \bigcup _n A_{i_{n}} \right ) = \sum _n m ( A_{i_{n}} ) . $

Both measurable and non-measurable sets exist.
