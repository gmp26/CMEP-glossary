A mapping between mathematical objects which preserves some aspect of
their structure; for example a homomorphism - which preserves group
structure - or an isomorphism - which preserves algebraic structure.

A morphism may be defined more generally as a mapping from one element
of a category to another, forming part of the definition of a category.
