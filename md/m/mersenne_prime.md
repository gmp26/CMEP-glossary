A prime number which can be written in the form $2^{n}-1$ is called a
Mersenne prime. The Mersenne number $M_{n}$ is prime for many values of
n, for instance n=2, 3, 5, 7, 13.

It is necessary for n to be prime, but not every prime number $n$ leads
to a Mersenne prime $2^{n}-1;$ for instance $n=11$ does not give a
Mersenne prime. The first few are:

$2^{2}-1  = 3$,

$2^{3}-1  = 7$,

$2^{5}-1  = 31$,

$2^{7}-1  = 127$,

$2^{13}-1  = 8191$,

Note that if $2^{n}-1$ is prime, then $2^{p-1}(2^{p}-1)$ is a perfect
number.
