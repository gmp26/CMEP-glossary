A group G is called a metabelian group if
$ \mathrm{G} ^{\prime} \subseteq \mathrm{Z(G)} $ where
$ \mathrm{G} ^{\prime} $ is the group generated by all commutators
$[x,y]=x^{-1}y^{-1}xy$ of G ( $ \mathrm{G} ^{\prime} $ is called the
commutator subgroup of G), and Z(G) is the centre of G, i.e. the group
containing those elements of G which each commute with every element of
G.
