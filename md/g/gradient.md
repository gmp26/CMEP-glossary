The slope of a line, at a particular point. A horizontal line has
gradient 0; a vertical line has infinite (undefined) gradient.

The gradient of a straight line is equal to the change in y coordinate
divided by the corresponding change in x coordinate.

Gradient is the tangent of the angle between the line and the
horizontal.
