The 53rd uniform polyhedron is the Great icosicosidodecahedron; it has
Wythoff symbol 3/2 5|3. Its dual is the great icosacronic
hexecontahedron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is
(6,3/2,6,5); its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.

It has:

Euler characteristic: -8

Density: 6

Number of vertices: 60

Number of edges: 120

Number of faces: 52 (=20 hexagons and 12 pentagons and
20<span>3/2</span>).

Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining
every $b^{th}$ of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made
by taking five points and joining every second point.
