The 22nd uniform polyhedron is the Great rhombicuboctahedron; it has
Wythoff symbol 3/2 4|2. Its dual is the great deltoidal
icositetrahedron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is
(4,3/2,4,4); its symmetry group is the octahedral group S4.

It has:

Euler characteristic: 2

Density: 5

Number of vertices: 24

Number of edges: 48

Number of faces: 26 (=18 quadrilaterals and 8<span>3/2</span>).

Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining
every $b^{th}$ of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made
by taking five points and joining every second point.
