The 78th uniform polyhedron is the Great rhombidodecahedron; it has
Wythoff symbol 3/2 5/3 2|. Its dual is the great rhombidodecacron. The
pattern of polygons round each vertex is (4,10/3,4/3,10/7); its symmetry
group is the icosahedral group A5.

It has:

Euler characteristic: -18

It is one-sided; it has

Number of vertices: 60

Number of edges: 120

Number of faces: 42 (=15 quadrilaterals and 6<span>10/3</span>and
6<span>10/7</span>and 15<span>4/3</span>).

Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining
every $b^{th}$ of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made
by taking five points and joining every second point.
