The 73rd uniform polyhedron is the Great truncated icosidodecahedron; it
has Wythoff symbol 5/3 2 3|. Its dual is the great
disdyakistriacontahedron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is
(10/3,4,6); its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.

It has:

Euler characteristic: 2

Density: 13

Number of vertices: 120

Number of edges: 180

Number of faces: 62 (=20 hexagons and 30 quadrilaterals and
12<span>10/3</span>).

Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining
every $b^{th}$ of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made
by taking five points and joining every second point.
