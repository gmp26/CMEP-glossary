The 72nd uniform polyhedron is the Great rhombicosidodecahedron; it has
Wythoff symbol 5/3 3|2. Its dual is the great deltoidal hexecontahedron.
The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (4,5/3,4,3); its symmetry
group is the icosahedral group A5.

It has:

Euler characteristic: 2

Density: 13

Number of vertices: 60

Number of edges: 120

Number of faces: 62 (=30 quadrilaterals and 20 triangles and
12<span>5/3</span>).

Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining
every $b^{th}$ of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made
by taking five points and joining every second point.
