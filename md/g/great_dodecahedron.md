The 40th uniform polyhedron is the Great dodecahedron; it has Wythoff
symbol 5/2|2 5. Its dual is the small stellated dodecahedron. The
pattern of polygons round each vertex is (5,5,5,5,5)/2; its symmetry
group is the icosahedral group A5.

It has:

Euler characteristic: -6

Density: 3

Number of vertices: 12

Number of edges: 30

Number of faces: 12 (=12 pentagons).

Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining
every $b^{th}$ of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made
by taking five points and joining every second point.
