If F is a field that extends a field K, then the set of all
automorphisms of F which leave every element of K unchanged, is a group.
It is called the Galois group of F over K, denoted Gal(F/K).

ie,
$ \mathrm{Gal(F/K)} = { \theta \in \mathrm{Aut(F)|} \theta ( \mathrm{a} )
= \mathrm{a} \; \forall \mathrm{a} \in \mathrm{K} }  . $
