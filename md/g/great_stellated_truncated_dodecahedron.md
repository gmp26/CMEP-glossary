The 71st uniform polyhedron is the Great stellated truncated
dodecahedron; it has Wythoff symbol 2 3|5/3. Its dual is the great
triakisicosahedron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is
(10/3,10/3,3); its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.

It has:

Euler characteristic: 2

Density: 13

Number of vertices: 60

Number of edges: 90

Number of faces: 32 (=12<span>10/3</span>and 20 triangles).

Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining
every $b^{th}$ of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made
by taking five points and joining every second point.
