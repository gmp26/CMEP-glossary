The 19th uniform polyhedron is the Great cubicuboctahedron; it has
Wythoff symbol 3 4|4/3. Its dual is the great hexacronic
icositetrahedron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is
(8/3,3,8/3,4); its symmetry group is the octahedral group S4.

It has:

Euler characteristic: -4

Density: 4

Number of vertices: 24

Number of edges: 48

Number of faces: 20 (=6 quadrilaterals and 8 triangles and
6<span>8/3</span>).

Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining
every $b^{th}$ of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made
by taking five points and joining every second point.
