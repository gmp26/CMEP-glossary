A polyhedron (or part of one) formed as follows:

Take a polyhedron and its circumsphere. Replace each face of the
polyhedron by some configuration of (identical isosceles) triangles, and
raise the new vertices so formed so that they lie on the circumsphere.

There are many different geodesic domes, corresponding to different
choices of initial polyhedron and different configurations of triangles
to replace the faces.
