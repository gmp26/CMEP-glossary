The 68th uniform polyhedron is the Great dodecicosahedron; it has
Wythoff symbol 5/3 5/2 3|. Its dual is the great dodecicosacron. The
pattern of polygons round each vertex is (6,10/3,6/5,10/7); its symmetry
group is the icosahedral group A5.

It has:

Euler characteristic: -28

It is one-sided; it has

Number of vertices: 60

Number of edges: 120

Number of faces: 32 (=10 hexagons and 6<span>10/3</span>and
6<span>10/7</span>and 10<span>6/5</span>).

Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining
every $b^{th}$ of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made
by taking five points and joining every second point.
