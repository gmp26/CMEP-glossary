The 58th uniform polyhedron is the Great icosahedron; it has Wythoff
symbol 5/2|2 3. Its dual is the great stellated dodecahedron. The
pattern of polygons round each vertex is (3,3,3,3,3)/2; its symmetry
group is the icosahedral group A5.

It has:

Euler characteristic: 2

Density: 7

Number of vertices: 12

Number of edges: 30

Number of faces: 20 (=20 triangles).

Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining
every $b^{th}$ of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made
by taking five points and joining every second point.
