The 79th uniform polyhedron is the Great retrosnub icosidodecahedron; it
has Wythoff symbol |3/2 5/3 2. Its dual is the great pentagrammic
hexecontahedron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is
(3,3/2,3,5/3,3); its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.

It has:

Euler characteristic: 2

Density: 37

Number of vertices: 60

Number of edges: 150

Number of faces: 92 (=60 triangles and 12<span>5/3</span>and
20<span>3/2</span>).

Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining
every $b^{th}$ of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made
by taking five points and joining every second point.
