A proof that works from a given geometric diagram and deduces new facts
about the sizes of angles, lengths of lines or relationships between
points and lines. For instance, a geometric proof might start from a
diagram showing a cyclic quadrilateral and establish that opposite
angles in the quadrilateral add up to $180^{\circ}$.
