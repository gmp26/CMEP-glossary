A continuous distribution for a variable which takes positive values; it
has frequency function:
$$\mathrm{f(x)} = \frac{\mathrm{x}^{\mathrm{a} -1} \mathrm{e}^{- \mathrm{x/b}}}
{ \mathrm{b}^{\mathrm{a}} \Gamma ( \mathrm{a} ) } .$$ x, a, and b must
be positive, and $ \Gamma $ is a gamma function. If a=1, it is the same
as the exponential distribution.
