The 25th uniform polyhedron is the Great truncated cuboctahedron; it has
Wythoff symbol 4/3 2 3|. Its dual is the great disdyakisdodecahedron.
The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (8/3,4,6); its symmetry
group is the octahedral group S4.

It has:

Euler characteristic: 2

Density: 1

Number of vertices: 48

Number of edges: 72

Number of faces: 26 (=8 hexagons and 12 quadrilaterals and
6<span>8/3</span>).

Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining
every $b^{th}$ of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made
by taking five points and joining every second point.
