$ \sqrt{2} $ is irrational.

Justification: If $ \sqrt{2} $ were rational we could write
$ \sqrt{2} = \frac{\mathrm{p}}{\mathrm{q}} $ with p, q integers having
no common factors. But then we have
$ 2 = \frac{\mathrm{p}^2}{\mathrm{q}^2} $ by squaring both sides, and
$2q^{2}=p^{2}.$

The left hand side has a factor of 2, so the right hand side must also
have a factor of 2, so p must be divisible by 2, i.e. we can write p=2r.
Then we have $2q^{2}=4r^{2} or q^{2}=2r^{2}.$ This means that q must
have a factor of 2. So p and q have a common factor of 2, which
contradicts our assumption that p and q have no common factors. So we
conclude that we cannot write $ \sqrt{2} $ as a fraction, so it is
irrational.
