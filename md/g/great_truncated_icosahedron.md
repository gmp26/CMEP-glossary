The 60th uniform polyhedron is the Great truncated icosahedron; it has
Wythoff symbol 2 5/2|3. Its dual is the great
stellapentakisdodecahedron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is
(6,6,5/2); its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.

It has:

Euler characteristic: 2

Density: 7

Number of vertices: 60

Number of edges: 90

Number of faces: 32 (=20 hexagons and 12<span>5/2</span>).

Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining
every $b^{th}$ of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made
by taking five points and joining every second point.
