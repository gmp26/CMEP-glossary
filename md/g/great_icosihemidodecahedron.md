The 76th uniform polyhedron is the Great icosihemidodecahedron; it has
Wythoff symbol 3/2 3|5/3. Its dual is the great icosihemidodecacron. The
pattern of polygons round each vertex is (10/3,3/2,10/3,3); its symmetry
group is the icosahedral group A5.

It has:

Euler characteristic: -4

It is one-sided; it has

Number of vertices: 30

Number of edges: 60

Number of faces: 26 (=6<span>10/3</span>and 10 triangles and
10<span>3/2</span>).

Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining
every $b^{th}$ of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made
by taking five points and joining every second point.
