The 74th uniform polyhedron is the Great inverted snub
icosidodecahedron; it has Wythoff symbol |5/3 2 3. Its dual is the great
inverted pentagonal hexecontahedron. The pattern of polygons round each
vertex is (3,5/3,3,3,3); its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.

It has:

Euler characteristic: 2

Density: 13

Number of vertices: 60

Number of edges: 150

Number of faces: 92 (=80 triangles and 12<span>5/3</span>).

Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining
every $b^{th}$ of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made
by taking five points and joining every second point.
