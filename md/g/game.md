For the purposes of the mathematical study of games, known as game
theory, a game is a competitive situation where:

There are a finite number of players;

Each player has a finite number of choices of what to do at each stage;

A player does not know in advance what the other players are going to
do;

At the end of the game, the players win or lose something, depending on
the outcome of the game.
