The 66th uniform polyhedron is the Great dodecicosidodecahedron; it has
Wythoff symbol 5/2 3|5/3. Its dual is the great dodecacronic
hexecontahedron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is
(10/3,5/2,10/3,3); its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.

It has:

Euler characteristic: -16

Density: 10

Number of vertices: 60

Number of edges: 120

Number of faces: 44 (=12<span>10/3</span>and 20 triangles and
12<span>5/2</span>).

Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining
every $b^{th}$ of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made
by taking five points and joining every second point.
