If we are given a triangle ABC and we draw the Gergonne triangle DEF,
with D, E, F lying on BC, CA, AB respectively, then we can find the
intersections of corresponding sides of these two triangles. BC and EF
intersect at P, CA and FD at Q, AB and DE at R. then P, Q and R lie on a
line, which is called the Gergonne line of ABC.

It has the property that it is perpendicular to the Soddy line of ABC.
