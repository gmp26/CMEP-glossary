Group theory is the study of groups. Groups are finite or infinite sets together with a binary operation (e.g. addition) often 
denoted $*$ which abide by the following four axioms:

Closure - if $x$ and $y$ are in the group, then so are $x*y$ and $y*x$.

Associativity - for any $x$,$y$, and $z$ in the group, $x*(y*z) = (x*y)*z$   
(This removes the need for brackets).

Identity - there must be an element in the group, $e$, such that $e*x=x*e=x$ for any $x$ in the group.

Inverses - for every element $x$ in the group, there must be an element $y$ in the group such that $x*y=y*x=e$.
