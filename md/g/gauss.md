Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855): German mathematician.

He wrote on number theory and geometry, and famously discovered a way to
construct a regular 17-gon with compasses and straightedge. His work
covered many areas of mathematics, including number theory, differential
equations, differential geometry, non-euclidean geometry, functions of a
complex variable, the orbits of the planets, series, approximate
integration, and methods of approximation in general. He is considered
one of the most important mathematicians in history, and perhaps the
most gifted mathematician of all time.
