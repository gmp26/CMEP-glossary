The vector with x and y components
$ \frac {\partial \mathrm{f}}{\partial 
\mathrm{x}} $ and $ \frac {\partial \mathrm{f}}{\partial \mathrm{y}} . $

This is often written grad(f) or $ \nabla \mathrm{f} . $

The rate of change of f at (x,y) as we move in direction (u,v) is given
by $ \nabla \mathrm{f(x,y)} \cdot \mathrm{(u,v)} . $

$ \nabla \mathrm{f} $ is normal to surfaces on which f is constant.
