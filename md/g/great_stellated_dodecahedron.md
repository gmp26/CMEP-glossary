The 57th uniform polyhedron is the Great stellated dodecahedron; it has
Wythoff symbol 3|2 5/2. Its dual is the great icosahedron. The pattern
of polygons round each vertex is (5/2,5/2,5/2); its symmetry group is
the icosahedral group A5.

It has:

Euler characteristic: 2

Density: 7

Number of vertices: 20

Number of edges: 30

Number of faces: 12 (=12<span>5/2</span>).

Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining
every $b^{th}$ of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made
by taking five points and joining every second point.
