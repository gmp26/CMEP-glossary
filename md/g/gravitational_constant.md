The constant, which is usually assumed to be the same at all times and
places, which measures the strength of the gravitational force.

In the inverse square law of gravitation, $ F = \frac{GM_1 M_2}{r^2} , $
G is the universal gravitational constant.

It is equal to about $6.67390 \times 10^{-11} \mathrm{m}^{3}/kg/s^{2}.$

It has dimensions $M^{-1}L^{3}T^{-2}$ and SI unit $Nm^{2}kg^{-2}.$
