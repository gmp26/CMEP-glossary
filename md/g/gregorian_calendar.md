The calendar which is widely used in the west today; it was introduced
by Pope Gregory though not adopted in all countries straight away (in
some places it was not used until early in the 20th century).

It differs from previous calendars by having a leap year every four
years, except if the year number ends in 00, in which case the year is
only a leap year if it is also divisible by 400.

At the time when it was introduced, the calendar year had moved compared
with the ’real’ year of the seasons, so a number of days had to be
omitted from the first year.
