The 52nd uniform polyhedron is the Great ditrigonal icosidodecahedron;
it has Wythoff symbol 3/2|3 5. Its dual is the great triambic
icosahedron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is
(3,5,3,5,3,5)/2; its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.

It has:

Euler characteristic: -8

Density: 6

Number of vertices: 20

Number of edges: 60

Number of faces: 32 (=12 pentagons and 20 triangles).

Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining
every $b^{th}$ of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made
by taking five points and joining every second point.
