The 80th uniform polyhedron is the Great dirhombicosidodecahedron; it
has Wythoff symbol |3/2 5/3 3 5/2. Its dual is the great
dirhombicosidodecacron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is
(4,5/3,4,3,4,5/2,4,3/2); its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.

It has:

Euler characteristic: -56

It is two-sided; it has

Number of vertices: 60

Number of edges: 240

Number of faces: 124 (=60 quadrilaterals and 20 triangles and
12<span>5/2</span>and 12<span>5/3</span>and 20<span>3/2</span>).

Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining
every $b^{th}$ of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made
by taking five points and joining every second point.
