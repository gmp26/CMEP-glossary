The 41st uniform polyhedron is the Great dodecadodecahedron; it has
Wythoff symbol 2|5/2 5. Its dual is the medial rhombic triacontahedron.
The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (5/2,5,5/2,5); its symmetry
group is the icosahedral group A5.

It has:

Euler characteristic: -6

Density: 3

Number of vertices: 30

Number of edges: 60

Number of faces: 24 (=12 pentagons and 12<span>5/2</span>).

Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining
every $b^{th}$ of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made
by taking five points and joining every second point.
