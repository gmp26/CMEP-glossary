The 75th uniform polyhedron is the Great dodecahemidodecahedron; it has
Wythoff symbol 5/3 5/2|5/3. Its dual is the great dodecahemidodecacron.
The pattern of polygons round each vertex is (10/3,5/3,10/3,5/2); its
symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.

It has:

Euler characteristic: -12

It is one-sided; it has

Number of vertices: 30

Number of edges: 60

Number of faces: 18 (=6<span>10/3</span>and 6<span>5/2</span>and
6<span>5/3</span>).

Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining
every $b^{th}$ of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made
by taking five points and joining every second point.
