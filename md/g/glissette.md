If we have two fixed curves, and we let a curve S of fixed shape and
length slide with its ends on the fixed curves, then the locus of a
point moving with S is called a glissette. An example is the locus of
the midpoint of a line segment sliding with its ends on two
perpendicular lines; this locus is a circle.
