Evariste Galois (1811-1832): A French mathematician. He died of wounds
sustained in a duel a the age of 20.

He worked on continued fractions, elliptic functions and abelian
integrals. His most famous work was on the solution of polynomial
equations by radicals, including the celebrated result that a quintic
equation cannot in general be solved by radicals. The branch of group
theory arising from his method of treating this problem is named Galois
theory, in his honour.
