A continuous distribution whose graph looks like a bell-shaped curve.
The distribution is symmetric. The probability density function is
$$\varphi ( x ) = \frac{1}{ \sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} \mathrm{exp} \left ( 
\frac{-(\mathrm{x} - \mu ) ^2 }{2 \sigma ^2} \right )$$

The mean is $ \mu $ and the variance is $ \sigma ^2 $. This distribution
is notated $ \mathrm{N} ( \mu , \sigma ^2 ) . $ A variable with this
distribution can take any finite value.

This distribution occurs very often in real-world sets of data, and it
is often the limit to which the sum of a large number of random
variables tends.

It has MGF
$$M( \theta ) = \exp ( \mu \theta + \frac{1}{2} \sigma ^2 \theta ^2 ) .$$

The cumulative distribution function of an $ N(0,1) $ random variable is
usually written $  \Phi (x) $ .
