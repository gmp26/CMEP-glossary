In two dimensions, if a closed curve C encloses a region R in which
functions P(x,y) and Q(x,y) have continuous partial derivatives, then:
$$\int_{\mathrm{C}} ( \mathrm{Pdx + Qdy} ) = \int_{\mathrm{R}} \left ( \frac{\partial \mathrm{Q}}{\partial \mathrm{x}}
- \frac{\partial \mathrm{P}}{\partial \mathrm{y}} \right ) \mathrm{dA}$$

In three dimensions, if a closed surface S encloses a volume V in which
a vector function F has continuous partial derivatives, then:
$$\int_{\mathrm{S}} ( \mathrm{F.n} ) \mathrm{dA} = \int_{\mathrm{V}} ( \nabla \mathrm{.F} ) \mathrm{dV}$$
