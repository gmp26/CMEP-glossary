The 70th uniform polyhedron is the Great dodecahemicosahedron; it has
Wythoff symbol 5/4 5|3. Its dual is the great dodecahemicosacron. The
pattern of polygons round each vertex is (6,5/4,6,5); its symmetry group
is the icosahedral group A5.

It has:

Euler characteristic: -8

It is one-sided; it has

Number of vertices: 30

Number of edges: 60

Number of faces: 22 (=10 hexagons and 6 pentagons and
6<span>5/4</span>).

Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining
every $b^{th}$ of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made
by taking five points and joining every second point.
