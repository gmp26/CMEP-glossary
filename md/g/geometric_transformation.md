The process of changing a shape into another shape, or a set of numbers
into another, different set of numbers.

Transformations in geometry include: translation, reflection, rotation,
glide, all of which leaves the shape unchanged while a stretch, shear,
enlargement and a topological transformation alters the original shape.
