The 47th uniform polyhedron is the Great ditrigonal
dodecicosidodecahedron; it has Wythoff symbol 3 5|5/3. Its dual is the
great ditrigonal dodecacronic hexecontahedron. The pattern of polygons
round each vertex is (10/3,3,10/3,5); its symmetry group is the
icosahedral group A5.

It has:

Euler characteristic: -16

Density: 4

Number of vertices: 60

Number of edges: 120

Number of faces: 44 (=12 pentagons and 12<span>10/3</span>and 20
triangles).

Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining
every $b^{th}$ of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made
by taking five points and joining every second point.
