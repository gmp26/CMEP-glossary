The 64th uniform polyhedron is the Truncated dodecadodecahedron; it has
Wythoff symbol 5/3 2 5|. Its dual is the medial
disdyakistriacontahedron. The pattern of polygons round each vertex is
(10/3,4,10); its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.

It has:

Euler characteristic: -6

Density: 3

Number of vertices: 120

Number of edges: 180

Number of faces: 54 (=12<span>10</span>and 30 quadrilaterals and
12<span>10/3</span>).

Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining
every $b^{th}$ of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made
by taking five points and joining every second point.
