A famous problem which asks, given a particular network of streets and a
particular list of addresses to be visited in no particular order, what
is the quickest way to visit all the addresses. The problem can always
be solved by checking every possible route and finding the shortest, but
this can take a very long time for some networks. Quicker ways to solve
the problem are hard or impossible to find.
