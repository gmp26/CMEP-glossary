The 30th uniform polyhedron is the Truncated icosahedron (this is the
shape of a football, or a ’buckyball’). It has Wythoff symbol 2 5|3. Its
dual is the pentakisdodecahedron. The pattern of polygons round each
vertex is (6,6,5); its symmetry group is the icosahedral group A5.

It has:

Euler characteristic: 2

Density: 1

Number of vertices: 60

Number of edges: 90

Number of faces: 32 (=20 hexagons and 12 pentagons).
