Any one of quite a wide variety of different mathematical results;
generally a Tauberian theorem is a result which enables us to recover
some of the properties of a mathematical object after it has been
through some kind of averaging process. Often we will have a highly
irregular object which we will make more regular by some procedure; then
a Tauberian theorem will allow us to recover some information about the
original object from the averaged object. Often the objects concerned
are Fourier series, etc.
