A simple way of counting things; we make one vertical mark for each
thing until we get to the fifth thing, when we make a horizontal mark
through the first four marks. After that we start a new group of
vertical marks, and repeat the process. This makes it quite easy to
count the groups of five and see how many things we have counted.
