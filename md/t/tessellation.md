A way of completely covering a plane with shapes which do not overlap.

There are three possible tessellations of the plane using identical
regular polygons; they use regular hexagons, squares, or equilateral
triangles. Using different regular polygons or irregular shapes there
are many more. Some tessellations possess translational symmetry, but
not all do.
