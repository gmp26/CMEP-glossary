A power series of the form:
$$f(x+a)=f(a)+f'(a)x+f''(a)x^{2}/2+f'''(a)x^{3}/3!+... +f^{(n-1)}(a)x^{n-1}/(n-1)!+R_{n}$$
is called a Taylor series. Taylorâ€™s theorem states the conditions under
which such a function will exist for a function f. $R_{n}$ is a
remainder term; it can be written in various forms; its value is usually
small.
