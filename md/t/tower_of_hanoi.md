Tower of Hanoi

An ancient problem:

You are given a set of discs, all of different sizes, and three spots on
which you are allowed to put discs. To start with the discs are piled in
order of size on one of the spots, with the smallest discs at the top.
You must transfer all of the discs to one of the other spots, without
ever putting a larger disc on top of a smaller one, and only ever moving
one disc at a time.

The problem can be solved for any number of discs, but the number of
moves it takes is very large. There is a story about a monk who is
carrying out the solution with sixty-four discs, moving one each second;
when he finishes the world will end. But the length of time it will take
is far longer than the age of the universe...
