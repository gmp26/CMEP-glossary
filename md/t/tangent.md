In a right angled triangle, if one of the angles is $\alpha$, then the
tangent of $\alpha$ is the ratio of lengths of the side opposite
$\alpha$ to the side next to $\alpha$. This definition is only useful if
$\alpha < 90^\circ$.

More generally, define:
$$\tan(\alpha) = \frac{\sin(\alpha)}{\cos(\alpha)}.$$
