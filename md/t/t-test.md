A test for whether a particular set of data comes from a normal
distribution with mean $ \mu _0 . $ If there are $n$ items of data, then
the statistic $$t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu _0 } { s/ \sqrt{n}},$$ where
$$s ^2 = \frac{1}{n -1} \sum _{i} ( x_{i} - \bar{x} ) ^2$$ has the
t-distribution with n-1 degrees of freedom - this is the null
hypothesis. Critical values of the t-distribution are given in tables.
