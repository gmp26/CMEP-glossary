Informally, the tangent line to a curve at a given point is the straight line that "just touches" the curve at that point.

More precisely, a straight line is said to be a tangent of a curve y = f(x) at a point x = c on the curve if it passes through the point (c, f(c)) on the curve and has gradient f'(c).
