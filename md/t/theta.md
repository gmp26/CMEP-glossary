The Greek letter $ \theta $ (lower case) or $ \Theta $ (upper case),
corresponding to the English ’th’; often used for angles.

Small theta is often used to denote an unknown angle, or the angle in
two-dimensional polar co-ordinates, or the azimuth angle in 3-d polar
co-ordinates. It is also used to denote a general population parameter,
in statistics.
