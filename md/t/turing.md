Alan Turing, A British mathematician, worked at Bletchley Park during
the second World War, on the effort to crack the Enigma code.

He is famous for this and for his pioneering work on the mathematics of
computing. Turingâ€™s theorem tells us that there is in general no way to
tell whether a given computer program will ever come to an end, other
than by running it.
