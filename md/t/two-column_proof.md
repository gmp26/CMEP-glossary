A general way of writing out mathematical proofs: we use two columns; in
the left hand column is a list of statements, and in the right hand
column is the reason for the corresponding statement. The reason may be
one of the givens for the proof, or a well-known theorem, or one of the
earlier statements from the left-hand column.
