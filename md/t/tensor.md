A set of components - each of which is defined as a function of position
in some co-ordinate system - which obeys some given transformation law.
A tensor of order n has $n^{2}$ components.

This is a generalisation of the idea of a vector; in fact a vector is a
tensor of order 1. A tensor of order zero is a scalar.

A tensor can often be thought of as an array of values and manipulated
like a matrix.
