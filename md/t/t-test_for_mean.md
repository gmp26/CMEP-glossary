A test of the null hypothesis that the population mean has value
$ \mu . $ The distribution used is the t-distribution with n-1 degrees
of freedom, where n is the sample size; tables are given for this
distribution. The test statistic is
$ \frac{ \bar{x} - \mu }{ s / \sqrt{n}} $ where s is an unbiased
estimate of the population standard deviation, i.e. calculated using
divisor n-1. This test assumes that X is normally distributed.
