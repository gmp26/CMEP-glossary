$\tan$ is an abbreviation for the tangent of an angle.

Given an angle $\theta$ inside a right angled triangle:
$$\tan \theta = \frac{\mbox{opposite}}{\mbox{adjacent}}$$ where
*opposite* is the length of the side opposite $\theta$, and *adjacent*
is the length of the side next to $\theta$.

This definition only works for acute angles. For other angles define:
$$\tan \theta = \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}$$
