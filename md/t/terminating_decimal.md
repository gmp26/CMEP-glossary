A decimal fraction which comes to an end; the sequence of digits after
the decimal point does not continue forever. Eg 0.1, 0.563472, 0.667.

All terminating decimals are rational numbers, but not all rational
numbers have terminating decimal expansions. Eg 1/3 is rational, but its
decimal expansion goes on forever.
