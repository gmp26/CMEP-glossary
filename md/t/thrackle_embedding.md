For a given graph, a thrackle embedding is a function which turns each
vertex of the graph into a point, and each edge of the graph into a
continuous line, with the conditions that:

Lines do not cross themselves;

Each pair of lines intersects exactly once;

Two vertices connected by an edge will always be turned into two
endpoints and a line;

Two lines which intersect must cross at the point of intersection - or
they must meet at a common endpoint.

In the 1960s, Conway conjectured that there is no graph which has more
edges than vertices and has a thrackle embedding.
