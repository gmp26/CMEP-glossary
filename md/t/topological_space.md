A set X, together with a collection T of subsets of X, satisfying:

$\emptyset$ and X are both in T;

if A and B are in T, then the intersection of A and B is also in T;

if A, B, C, ... K are in T, then the union of A, B, C, ... K is also in
T.

We call the sets in T open sets, and we call T a topology on X.
