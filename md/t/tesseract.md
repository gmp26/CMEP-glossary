A four-dimensional object; it is analogous to a cube. The ’volume’ of a
tesseract with edge length x is $x^{4}.$

It has 16 vertices, 32 edges, 24 faces and 8 cells; the cells are cubes.
Its dual is the 16-cell. It can be used to tessellate four-dimensional
space.

The dual of the tesseract is the 16-cell.
