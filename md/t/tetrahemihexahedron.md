The 9th uniform polyhedron is the Tetrahemihexahedron; it has Wythoff
symbol 3/2 3|2 . Its dual is the tetrahemihexacron. The pattern of
polygons round each vertex is (4.3/2.4.3); its symmetry group is the
tetrahedral group A4

It has:

Euler characteristic: 1.

It is one-sided; it has

Number of vertices: 6

Number of edges: 12

Number of faces: 7 (=3 quadrilaterals and 2 triangles and
2<span>3/2</span>

Note: a polygon a/b means a shape made by taking a points and joining
every $b^{th}$ of them; for instance 5/2 means a five-pointed star made
by taking five points and joining every second point.
