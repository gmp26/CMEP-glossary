This is a test of the null hypothesis that the difference in two
population means is $ \mu , $ given a paired sample $(x_{i},$ $y_{i})$
of size n. The distribution used is t with (n-1) degrees of freedom, and
the test statistic is
$ \frac{ ( \bar{x} - \bar{y} ) - \mu }{ s / \sqrt{n} } . $ This test is
identical to the t test for a mean, treating the differences
$x_{i}-y_{i}$ as a single sample.
