The second counting number, equal to 1+1, or, more formally, what you
get when you combine the multiplicative identity with itself under
addition. It is the first prime number, and the only even prime number.
It is the only number apart from one to be equal to its own factorial.
Operations like addition, multiplication, etc. are most naturally
performed on two numbers. $ 2 \times 2 = 2+2 =4$ is the only case of
multiplication of integers have the same effect as addition. 2 is the
first deficient number. The equation $x^{n}+y^{n}=z^{n}$ has integer
solutions only for n=2. So does the equation $n^{x}+n^{y}=n^{z}.$ It is
the third Fibonacci number.
$ \phi(2)=1, \quad d(2)=2, \quad \sigma(2)=3 . $
