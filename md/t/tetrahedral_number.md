Tetrahedral numbers are the numbers which can be made by considering a
tetrahedral pattern of beads in three dimensions.

For example: if we make a triangle of beads with 3 beads to a side, and
on top of this we place a triangle with two beads to a side, and on top
of that a triangle with one bead to a side, we have made a tetrahedron
of beads. In this case the total number of beads is (3rd triangular
number)+(2nd triangular number)+(1st triangular number) =6+3+1=10.

In general the $n^{th}$ tetrahedral number is equal to the sum of the
first n triangular numbers. This is the same as the 4th number from the
left in the $(n+3)^{th}$ row of Pascal’s triangle.

We can use the binomial formula for numbers in Pascal’s triangle to show
that the nth tetrahedral number is $$^{n+2}C_{3},$$ or (n+2)(n+1)n/6.

The only numbers which are both tetrahedral and square are 4
$$(=2^{2}=T_{2}) and 19600 (=140^{2}=T_{48}).$$
