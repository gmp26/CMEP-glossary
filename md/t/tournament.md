A way of finding a winner from a group of players or teams: the teams
are put into pairs, which play each other, and the losing team from each
pair is ’knocked out’ of the tournament. This process is repeated until
only one team is left.

A tournament has the disadvantage that quite good teams may be knocked
out very early if they are unlucky about who they have to play against.

The word is also used in a more general way to mean any group of matches
between several teams which aims to find a single winner.
