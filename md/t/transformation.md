A transformation of a geometric object like the plane is when we have a
one-to-one mapping from S to S, where S is the set of points in the
object.

Examples are rotations, reflections, enlargements and translations.

We can also have transformations which act upon algebraic objects, where
there is a one-to-one mapping between sets of objects. We can have
transformations of any kind of objects.
