A number which can be represented by a triangular array of dots. 1, 3,
6, 10, are all triangular numbers.

The $n^{th}$ triangular number is n(n+1)/2.

Every integer is the sum of at most three triangular numbers.

If t is a triangular number, 8t+1 is a square.

The square of the $n^{th}$ triangular number is equal to the sum of the
first n cubes.

Certain triangular numbers are also squares, but no triangular number
can be a third, fourth or fifth power.
