This is an ancient puzzle, of Chinese origin, consisting of a square cut
into seven particular pieces that can be put together into many
different shapes.

The idea of the tangram from the Chinese, ch’i ch’ae pan, meaning the
Seven - Board of Cunning. The word is believed to come from the Chu era
(740 - 330 BC) of China, but how old the tangram puzzle is, is not
known.

The first book of Tans were first printed in the Ch’ing era (1796-
1820).
