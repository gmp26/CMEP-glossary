A way of performing approximate numerical integrations; it is equivalent
to assuming that the function being integrated is the same as a straight
line with the same end points as the function:
$$\int_{\mathrm{a}} ^{\mathrm{b}} \mathrm{f(x)dx} \approx 
\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{(b-a)(f(a)+f(b))}$$

This can be extended, to consider the region of integration divided into
n pieces of length h: $$\int _a ^b y dx \approx
\frac{1}{2} h [ ( y_0 + y_n ) + 2 ( y_1 + y_2 + \ldots + y_{n-1} ) ] ,$$
where $x_{i}$ divide [a,b] into n pieces of width h=(b-a)/n, with
$x_{0}=a and x_{n}=b, and y_{i}=y(x_{i}).$
