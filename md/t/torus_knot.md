A knot produced by winding a curve around a torus.

If we consider a torus to be formed as the product of two circles A and
B (we form the torus by rotating B around the circumference of A) then a
torus knot is produced by winding a curve p times around A and q times
around B. Such a knot is denoted $T_{p,q}.$ The trefoil is a specific
case of this: $T_{2,3}.$
