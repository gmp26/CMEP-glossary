A branch of mathematics concerned with the properties of geometric
figures which remain unchanged when the figures are distorted in some
way or another.

When a shape is bent, twisted or stretched: the number of nodes, the
order of the nodes, the number of arcs, the sequence of points along a
line and the number of regions, do not alter.

Topology is used to simplify maps - without altering any of the key
features, we can still give the essence of what is happening on the
ground.
