For a given function $f$ whose $(n-1)^{\mbox{th}}$ derivative is
continuous in $[a,b]$ and whose $n^{\mbox{th}}$ derivative exists in
$(a,b)$, we can write $f(x+a)$ as a Taylor series ie:
$$f(x+a)=f(a)+f'(a)x+f''(a)x^{2}/2+f'''(a)x^{3}/3!+... +f^{(n-1)}(a)x^{n-1}/(n-1)!+R_{n}.$$
($x+a$ must lie in $[a,b]$.) $R^{n}$ is a remainder term; it can be
written in various forms; its value is usually small.
