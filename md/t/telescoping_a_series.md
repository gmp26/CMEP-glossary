A method for finding the sum of certain series.

If we have a series ${a_{n}},$ and we can find a function f(n) such that
$a_{n}=f(n+1)-f(n)$ for every n, then
$$\sum _{\mathrm{i} =0 } ^{\mathrm{n}} \mathrm{a}_{\mathrm{i}}
= \sum _{\mathrm{i} =0 } ^{\mathrm{n}} \mathrm{f(i+1)-f(i)}$$
$$= \mathrm{f(n+1)-f(0)}$$ (because all the other terms cancel).

But finding such a function may be difficult, and is not always even
possible.
